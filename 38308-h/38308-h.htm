<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Objectives of the study here reported on were to: (1) learn as
    much as possible concerning the natural history and economic
    importance of the cottonmouth; (2) determine what factors limit
    its geographic distribution; (3) determine the role of the cottonmouth
    in its ecological community; and (4) compare the cottonmouth's
    life history with that of other crotalid snakes, especially the
    kinds that are most closely related to it.</p>
<p>Twenty-five live cottonmouths were kept in the laboratory for
    the purpose of studying behavior and fang shedding and for comparison
    of measurements with those of preserved specimens. Live
    snakes were obtained in Brazoria and Nacogdoches counties, Texas,
    from Hermann Park Zoo, Houston, Texas, and from the late Paul
    Anderson of Independence, Missouri. Preserved western cottonmouths
    were examined for the purpose of determining variation,
    distribution, food habits, body proportions, embryonic development,
    and reproductive cycles. The cottonmouths examined include:
    221 from Texas; 33 from Arkansas; 22 from Louisiana; 2
    from Illinois; and 1 each from Kansas, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.</p>
<p>In the preparation of this report I have examined all available
    literature pertaining to the cottonmouth and have drawn from
    these sources for comparative or additional material. Some of the
    more noteworthy contributions to knowledge of the cottonmouth
    are the general accounts of the life history by Allen and Swindell
    (1948), Barbour (1956), and Wright and Wright (1957); the publications
    by Gloyd and Conant (1943) concerning taxonomy;
    Klimstra (1959) concerning food habits; and Allen (1937), Parrish
    and Pollard (1959), Swanson (1946), and Wolff and Githens
    (1939b) concerning the venom. Numerous other publications,
    although brief, contain worthwhile contributions. Also of special
    interest as a source of material for comparison of cottonmouths with
    other crotalids are the works of Fitch (1960) on the copperhead and
    of Klauber (1956) on the rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>The cottonmouth has been well known for nearly 200 years.
    Wright and Wright (1957) listed the following vernacular names
    that are applied to the cottonmouth: black moccasin, black snake,
    blunt-tail moccasin, congo, copperhead, cottonmouth water moccasin,
    cotton-mouthed snake, gapper, highland moccasin, lowland
    moccasin, mangrove rattler, moccasin, North American cottonmouth
    snake, North American water moccasin, North American
    water viper, pilot, rusty moccasin, salt-water rattler, stubtail, stump <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span> (-tail) moccasin, stump-tail viper, swamp lion, Texas Moccasin,
    trapjaw, Troost's moccasin, true horn snake, true water moccasin,
    viper, water mokeson, water pilot, water rattlesnake, and water
    viper.</p>
<p>Some of the names listed above are based upon superstition and
    folklore prevailing in pioneer times, and others are based upon the
    behavior or appearance of the snake at various ages. Names like
    &quot;stump-tail moccasin&quot; are derived from the appearance of females
    which have short tails or snakes that have lost part of the tail.
    Names like &quot;gapper&quot; and &quot;trapjaw&quot; came to be applied because
    of the habit of the snake's lying with its mouth open when approached.
    The name &quot;cottonmouth&quot; also was derived from this
    behavior, although the lining of the mouth is whitish in most other
    snakes. The term &quot;rattlesnake&quot; may have come from the fact that
    the cottonmouth vibrates its tail vigorously when nervous as do
    many other snakes, or it may have been confused with rattlesnakes.
    Because of the general public's fear of snakes and their reluctance
    to learn to discriminate between the poisonous and harmless species,
    numerous kinds of snakes seen in or near water have been called
    moccasins. The general appearance, pugnacious behavior, and
    whitish mouth of water-snakes (<i>Natrix</i>) have earned them a bad
    reputation. In fact, a great majority of the &quot;cottonmouths&quot; reported
    in many areas are found to be water-snakes.</p>
<p>The cottonmouth is economically important mainly because of
    the injurious or fatal effects of its bite and the psychological effect
    that its actual or suspected presence has upon many persons. The
    species eats a wide variety of prey items and helps to prevent overabundance
    of certain kinds of organisms. The venom has been
    used in the therapeutic treatment of blood clots owing to its anticoagulant
    properties (Didisheim and Lewis, 1956). It also is employed
    in the treatment of haemorrhagic conditions and rheumatoid
    arthritis, as well as in the production of antivenin (Allen and
    Swindell, <i>op cit.</i>:13). None of these uses of venom has become
    widely accepted, and its value is questionable.</p>

<h2>SYSTEMATIC RELATIONSHIPS AND DISTRIBUTION</h2>
<p>Snakes of the genus <i>Agkistrodon</i> are relatively primitive members of the
    Crotalidae, which is one of the most specialized families of snakes. A majority
    of the pit-vipers are found in the Americas, but close relatives are found from
    extreme southeastern Europe through temperate Asia to Japan (<i>A. halys</i>) and
    southeastern Asia including Indonesia (<i>Agkistrodon</i> and <i>Trimeresurus</i>). Familial
    characters include: vertical pupil of the eye; facial pit present between
    the preoculars and loreal; scales usually keeled; short, rotatable maxilla bearing
    a large hollow fang; toothless premaxilla; chiefly hematoxic venom; and undivided
    anal plate.</p>
<p>The genus <i>Agkistrodon</i> includes about nine species in the Old World and
    three in North and Central America. Some of the primitive characters of the
    genus are: head covered with nine enlarged shields or having the internasals
    and prefrontals broken up into small scales; subcaudals on proximal part of
    tail undivided; fangs relatively short; tail lacking rattles. In one species, <i>A.
    rhodostoma</i>, the scales are smooth; and the female is oviparous and guards her
    eggs until they hatch. Other species have keeled scales and are ovo-viviparous.</p>
<p>There is little paleontological evidence illustrating evolution of the cottonmouth
    or for that matter of crotalids in general. Brattstrom (1954) summarized
    the current knowledge of fossil pit-vipers in North America. The few fossils
    found of the cottonmouth are from Alacha, Brevard, Citrus, Levy, Pasco, and
    Pinellas counties, Florida (Brattstrom, <i>op. cit.</i>:35; Auffenberg, 1963:202). All
    are of late Pleistocene Age and well within the present geographic range of the
    cottonmouth.</p>
<p>Of crotalid genera only <i>Agkistrodon</i> occurs in both the Old World and the
    New World, suggesting that this genus is relatively old. Schmidt (1946:
    149-150) mentioned several other closely related groups of animals found in
    both eastern Asia and eastern North America, including the reptilian genera: <i>Natrix</i>, <i>Opheodrys</i>, <i>Elaphe</i>, <i>Ophisaurus</i>, <i>Leiolopisma</i> (= <i>Lygosoma</i>), <i>Eumeces</i>, <i>Clemmys</i>, <i>Emmys</i>, and <i>Alligator</i>. Of the groups of animals now confined to
    these two regions the most important are the cryptobranchid salamanders, the
    genus <i>Alligator</i>, and the spoon-bills (<i>Psephurus</i> in China and <i>Polyodon</i> in the
    Mississippi drainage). Fossil evidence for these groups indicates that existing
    forms common to eastern Asia and eastern North America are remnants of a
    late Cretaceous or early Tertiary Holarctic fauna which was forced southward
    as the climate became gradually cooler to the north. &quot;Other clues suggest
    that both <i>Agkistrodon</i> and <i>Trimeresurus</i> (<i>Bothrops</i>) moved from Asia to
    America, one of these presumably giving rise to the rattlesnakes.&quot; (Darlington,
    1957:228).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>
<p>The named, American kinds of <i>Agkistrodon</i> currently are arranged as three
    species: the copperhead, the cantil and the cottonmouth. The copperhead
    (<i>A. contortrix</i>) is divided into four subspecies, all of which are terrestrial. This
    species occurs from southern New England to eastern Kansas and along the
    Atlantic and Gulf Coastal plains, exclusive of peninsular Florida and the delta
    of the Mississippi River in Louisiana. It extends southwest from Kansas through
    the Edwards Plateau of west-central Texas. Isolated populations occur in the
    Chisos and Davis mountains of Trans-Pecos Texas. The cantil or Mexican
    moccasin (<i>A. bilineatus</i>), probably the nearest relative of the cottonmouth
    (<i>A. piscivorus</i>), is divisible into two subspecies and occupies a nearly complementary
    range from Mexico south to Nicaragua. The cottonmouth occurs
    throughout the coastal plains of the southeastern United States, usually at
    altitudes of 500 feet or less. Two subspecies are recognized, the eastern <i>A. p.
    piscivorus</i> and the western <i>A. p. leucostoma</i>. A revision of the genus is underway
    by Professor Howard K. Gloyd.</p>
<p>The basic pattern and various behavioral traits are common to all three
    species. The young are more nearly alike in appearance than adults, the
    copperhead and the cottonmouth being easily confused. Adults differ in
    color, size, body proportions, habitat, and habits. In range and habitat preference
    the cottonmouth more closely resembles the southern subspecies of
    the copperhead, <i>A. c. contortrix</i>, which is usually found in lowlands, near
    swamps and streams, but seldom in water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fig. 1.</span> Geographic range of the cottonmouth, showing marginal and near-marginal
    records, based largely upon maps by Gloyd and Conant (1943:165)
    and Conant (1958:336) but including additional records. The more important
    of these records (from east to west) are discussed in the following paragraphs.
    Crosshatching indicates the area of intergradation between the eastern and
    western subspecies. Old records, indicated by dates, and their sources are as
    follows: 1850's and 1891&mdash;U. S. National Museum numbers 4263 and 32753
    respectively; 1897&mdash;Hurter (1897); and 1895&mdash;Stejneger (1895:408).</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span></p>
<p>The northernmost record for the eastern subspecies is in the Petersburg area,
    Prince George County, Virginia (Anon., 1953:24). A sight record (Hickman,
    1922:39) near Bristol, West Virginia, probably was based on a water-snake
    (<i>Natrix</i> sp.), since the stream in which the snake was seen flows north into the
    Ohio River rather than southeast through Virginia. In North Carolina the
    most inland record is from the Neuse River, six to eight miles east of Raleigh
    (Stejneger, 1895:408). Neill (1947:205) reported a population in the vicinity
    of Dry Fork Creek on the boundary line of Wilkes and Oglethorpe counties,
    Georgia. Distribution of cottonmouths in Florida is statewide, including the
    Keys and other offshore islands.</p>
<p>The ranges of the two subspecies, <i>piscivorus</i> and <i>leucostoma</i>, meet near the
    eastern border of Mississippi. <i>A. p. piscivorus</i> has been reported from Tishomingo
    County to the Gulf and east of the Loess Bluff area in central Mississippi,
    and <i>A. p. leucostoma</i> has been reported from this area westward. A few
    specimens from along the Coast indicate intergradation (Cook, 1962:33) between
    the two subspecies.</p>
<p>Barbour (1956:33) reported one specimen from Cypress Creek, in the Green
    River drainage, Muhlenberg County, Kentucky, and stated that suitable habitat
    can be found in several areas east of Kentucky Lake. Hence, cottonmouths
    may have entered this area via the Ohio River. Stejneger (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
    reported the species in the Wabash River at Mount Carmel, Wabash County,
    Illinois, and mentioned a former occurrence at Vincennes, Knox County,
    Indiana; but there are no recent records at these localities. Hurter (1897)
    reported having seen cottonmouths in Illinois, opposite St. Louis; Smith (1961:265)
    believes that this and a population in Monroe County, Illinois, are
    isolated relicts, since no specimens have been found within 50 miles to the
    south of Monroe County. The specimens reported by Anderson (1941:178;
    1945:274) near Chillicothe (three miles southwest and seven miles northwest,
    respectively), Livingston County, Missouri, also are thought to represent a relict
    population. Hall and Smith (1947:453) reported one specimen from Jasper
    County, Missouri, in the Spring River which flows through extreme southeastern
    Kansas and into Oklahoma and another in the Neosho River at Chetopa, Kansas.
    Both of these specimens were taken after a flood, and no additional
    specimens have been taken in this region. Nevertheless, sufficient habitat is
    probably available along the Neosho and Verdigris rivers in the southeastern
    part of Kansas.</p>
<p>In Texas the cottonmouth has penetrated marginal habitat perhaps farther
    than anywhere else in its range. Formerly it was thought to be limited to the
    country east of the Balcones Escarpment (Smith and Buechner, 1947:8), but
    semiarid areas of the state have been invaded primarily via the Colorado and
    Brazos River systems up to altitudes of 2300 feet. Two additional specimens
    are said to have been collected along the Rio Grande. Dr. Howard K. Gloyd
    (<i>in litt.</i>) stated that the specimen reported from Eagle Pass, Maverick County,
    is believed to have been taken in the 1850's; and the one said to have come
    from the mouth of the Devil's River is actually marked &quot;near Santa Rosa,
    Cameron County, September 30, 1891.&quot; No additional specimens have been
    taken in that area; and the range now probably extends no farther south than
    Corpus Christi, Texas. Brown's (1903:554) knowledge of the extension of
    the range of the cottonmouth west of longitude 98&deg; is probably based upon
    the records along the Rio Grande reported in the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Three extensions of the known range in Texas are reported herein. One
    specimen was captured by Mr. Harry Green (HWG 346) along the San Saba
    River, 8.1 miles west of Menard, Menard County. The other two specimens
    (KU 84375 and 84376) were taken by the late Paul Anderson one and one-half
    miles north of Pecan Crossing, South Concho River, Tom Green County,
    and one mile west of Mertzon, Irion County.</p>
<p>In the hypsithermal period following Pleistocene glaciation, cottonmouths
    gradually moved northward occupying areas beyond their present range. The
    distributional records since the 1850's and the apparent relict populations now
    in existence indicate that the range of this species has since receded.</p>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<h3>Color and Pattern</h3>
<p>Color predominantly brown, ranging through pale reddish-brown or dark
    reddish-brown, brownish-green, to almost black; 10 to 17 irregular dark brown
    bands on paler brown ground color; young paler (some nearly salmon pink),
    retaining a vivid pattern throughout first year; pattern of most individuals
    nearly obliterated by third year; brilliance and dullness of predominant color
    correlated with molting cycle (skin especially bright and shiny immediately
    following shedding; tip of tail yellowish in juveniles; posterior part of venter
    and tail uniformly black in some adult individuals, especially females; secondary
    sexual differences in dorsal coloration, such as found in copperhead by Fitch
    (1960:102), not noted.</p>
<p>The eastern subspecies, <i>A. p. piscivorus</i>, has the more brilliant pattern in
    which the centers of the dark cross-bands are invaded by the ground color.
    The cross-bands are slightly constricted in the mid-line and may or may not be
    bilaterally symmetrical. One-half of the cross-band may be displaced anteriorly
    or posteriorly to a slight degree or may even be completely absent. From one
    to several dark spots may be present within the cross-bands.</p>
<p>The western subspecies, <i>A. p. leucostoma</i>, has a comparatively dull pattern
    in which the ground color does not invade the center of the cross-bands. In
    many instances the bands are outlined by white scales, as in the Mexican
    moccasin (this character is not so prominent in <i>A. p. piscivorus</i> because of
    the paler ground color). A large, dark blotch usually occurs at the base of
    the cross-band and may completely cross the ventral scales. The characteristic
    variations found in <i>piscivorus</i> are also present in <i>leucostoma</i>.</p>
<p>The number of bands is often difficult to count because of the dark color
    of some specimens. Gloyd and Conant (1943:168) reported averages of 12.5
    (11 to 16) and 12.2 (10 to 16) in males and females, respectively, of <i>leucostoma</i> and ranges of 10 to 17 for males and 10 to 16 for females with averages
    of 13 in both sexes of <i>piscivorus</i>. On 20 specimens of <i>leucostoma</i> from Texas
    the average number of bands was 12.7 (11 to 15). If the number of bands
    differed on the two sides of an animal, the total number of the two sides was
    divided by two.</p>
<blockquote>
    <h3>Scutellation</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>The scutellation of the cottonmouth closely resembles that of the other
    species of <i>Agkistrodon</i>. For example, the nine cephalic shields are characteristic
    of most species of <i>Agkistrodon</i>, as well as most other primitive crotalids and
    viperids, and most colubrids. Most individuals have an additional pair of large
    scales behind the parietals.</p>
<p>The numbers of postoculars, supralabials, and infralabials are variable. On
    either side the postoculars (three in most specimens) are reduced to two in
    some specimens. The supralabials (eight in most specimens) frequently vary
    (usually on one side only) from seven to nine. The number of infralabials is
    somewhat more variable than the number of supralabials, the usual number
    being 11, but 10 is also common; 8, 9, and 12 are more rare (Table 1). In
    102 snakes in which these characters were examined, four different combinations
    of supralabials and seven combinations of infralabials were found. Both
    characters together yielded 16 combinations, considering only the actual number
    of scales and not taking into account the side of the head on which they
    occurred (Table 2). The combinations found in a brood of seven young from
    Houston, Texas, are shown in Table 3 to illustrate the variability of this character.
    Gloyd and Conant (1943:168) found a variation of 6 to 11 (8) and 7
    to 9 (8) supralabials and 8 to 13 (11) and 8 to 12 (10.4) infralabials in
    samples of 301 <i>leucostoma</i> and 119 <i>piscivorus</i>, respectively (numbers in
    parentheses represent average). Also of interest is the variability of the scales
    themselves. In one instance a scale was found that had not completely divided.
    In another specimen the last supralabial and last infralabial were one scale
    that completely lined the angle of the jaw. Instances of one scale almost <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span> crowding out another were common. In still other instances one or two
    supralabials were divided horizontally into two scales. Individual variation
    rather than geographical variation occurs in these characters.</p>

<p>The dorsal scales of cottonmouths are strongly keeled except that those of
    the two lower scale-rows on each side are weakly keeled. Also they are
    slightly larger than the others. Two apical pits are present on each dorsal
    scale. The shape of the scales and number of scale rows vary depending upon
    the position on the body. Scales on the neck are considerably smaller than
    those elsewhere on the body and are arranged in two or three more rows than
    those at mid-body. The skin in the region of the throat, neck, and fore-body is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span> especially elastic and allows the swallowing of large prey. Posteriorly from the
    mid-body the scales decrease in size and become more angular, those on the
    tail tending to be rhomboidal and wider than long. In the region of the anus
    the number of scale rows diminishes rapidly, leaving only 12 to 14 rows at the
    base of the tail and only three rows immediately ahead of the tail tip. The
    tail ends in a spine composed of two scales: one scale covers the bottom, lower
    parts of the sides, and tip of the spine; and a shorter dorsal scale covers the
    top and upper parts of the sides of the basal two-thirds of the spine. The
    spine of embryos and young cottonmouths is blunt, but is pointed in most
    adults.</p>

<p>The number of scale rows on the neck, at mid-body, and just anterior
    to the anus is relatively constant at 27-25-21, respectively; but some individual
    variation is evident (Table 4). Since the rows are diagonally arranged, it is
    necessary in counting scales to proceed either anteriorly or posteriorly across
    the back; or the row may be counted in either direction up to the center of the
    back and then reversed on the other side of the snake. In order to count the
    scale rows in a position where no scale reduction or addition was occurring
    and to avoid as much error as possible, I counted from anterior to center and
    back on the neck, in any direction at mid-body, and from posterior to center
    and back near the anus. Because females generally are the larger in circumference
    posteriorly, they could have more scale rows than males just anterior <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span> to the anus. The few snakes having more than 21 scale rows in the posterior
    region offer no conclusive evidence as to tendencies, but in both instances in
    which this occurred the females outnumbered the males three to one. An
    odd, rather than an even, number of scale rows occurs on most of the length
    of the snakes examined, because there is a mid-dorsal row and scale rows tend
    to be lost on both sides at about the same level. An example of scale reduction
    of one snake was as follows:</p>

<p>This scale reduction follows the method proposed by Dowling (1951b: 133)
    in which the numbers on the mid-line represent the number of scale rows,
    upper figures refer to the right side of the snake, and figures in parentheses indicate
    the number of the ventral scale (counted from the anterior end of the
    series), thus marking the position of the addition or reduction. Addition of
    a row is shown by a plus sign and the number of the row, whereas reductions
    are shown by a minus sign and the number of the row that is lost or by a
    plus sign between the number of two rows that join. According to Dowling,
    variation in number of dorsal scales characterizes the few genera and species
    of snakes in which it has been studied. The time and difficulty involved in
    ascertaining the number of scales explain why it has not been widely used in
    classification.</p>

    male <i>A. p. leucostoma</i>. </span></div>
<blockquote>
    <p>Ventral scales on 34 males averaged 134.4 (128 to 139), and on 48 females
        133.5 (128 to 137) (Fig. 2.). Barbour (1956:34) found an average of 135.3
        ventral scales on 64 males and 44 females, and Gloyd and Conant (<i>loc. cit.</i>)
        found an average of 134 for both males and females. The average for the
        eastern cottonmouth obtained by Gloyd and Conant, however, was 137 ventrals
        in both sexes. Some of my counts were made before I knew of the standard
        system of counting ventrals proposed by Dowling (1951a:97-99), in which <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span> the first ventral plate is defined as the most anterior one bordered on both
        sides by the first row of dorsals. Therefore, some inconsistencies may exist in
        my counts. Where differences occur, Dowling's method probably will indicate
        the presence of an additional scale, since it appears to begin farther anteriorly
        on the average, than I began counting.</p>

<p>Analysis of caudal scales revealed sexual dimorphism. In the six specimens
    from Tennessee, Blanchard (1922:16) found the same thing. Caudals averaged
    45.4 (41 to 50) on 34 males and 42.6 (39 to 49) on 44 females (Fig. 3).
    Barbour (<i>loc. cit.</i>) found an average of 45.7 (30 to 54) caudals in males and
    43 (17 to 56) in females. Caudal scale counts by Gloyd and Conant (<i>loc.
    cit.</i>) averaged 44 (38 to 49) in males and 42 (37 to 48) in females of <i>leucostoma</i>;
    in <i>piscivorus</i> they averaged 48 (42 to 53) in males and 44 (41 to 49)
    in females. Another seldom-mentioned, unusual characteristic of the caudal <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span> scales of copperheads and cottonmouths is that some are single (usually those
    at the base of the tail) and others divided (Table 5). To my knowledge, all
    other species have either single or divided scales the entire length of the tail.
    See Klauber (1941:73) and Fox (1948:252) concerning correlation of few
    scales with warm environment.</p>
<h3>Dentition</h3>
<p>Cottonmouths, like other pit-vipers, have their teeth reduced in number
    and have enlarged, highly specialized fangs. Small teeth occur on the palatine
    and the pterygoid in the upper jaw and on the dentary in the lower jaw. The
    dentary bone bears 17 curved teeth that decrease in size posteriorly. The
    palatine bears five small, strongly curved teeth, and the pterygoid bears 16 to
    18 strongly curved teeth decreasing in size posteriorly. The numbers of teeth
    mentioned above in each instance refer to the number of sockets rather than
    the actual number of teeth, because teeth are frequently shed, leaving some
    of the sockets empty at any one time.</p>
<p>The maxillary bone has two sockets side by side which bear the poison
    fangs, usually one at a time. During the period shortly before a fang is to be
    shed, however, its replacement becomes attached in the alternate socket; and
    both fangs may be functional for a short time. The old fang then becomes
    weakened at its base, eventually breaks off, and is swallowed. At any one
    time four or five replacement fangs in various stages of development are found
    in the gum behind the functional fang. These replacement fangs, which are
    arranged in alternate rows, gradually enlarge as they move forward in their
    development and, in juveniles, are generally slightly longer than the fangs that
    they replace.</p>
<p>In 1963 I examined the fangs of 14 cottonmouths at four- to seven-day intervals
    for a period of six weeks. The fang-shedding cycle was found to be
    highly irregular, with a double condition (on one or both sides) occurring one-third
    of the time. Approximately the same proportion of double fangs was
    found in preserved individuals. A replacement period of at least five days
    was observed in one snake. One-half the cycle (from replacement on one side
    to replacement on the other) varied from five to twenty days, indicating that
    the cycles for each fang are independent of one another. Bogert (1943:324)
    found that young rattlesnakes are born with functional fangs in the two inner
    sockets. Nonsynchronous use of the sockets on opposite sides of the head in
    rattlesnakes is a later development which results from accidents or other conditions
    leading to a longer retention of the fang on one side than on the other
    (Klauber, 1956:723). I found a double set of fangs in cottonmouths only
    twice in the six-week period. A complete cycle was recorded in ten instances
    in a period of 19 to 23 days and in two instances in 32 days. One cottonmouth
    was examined periodically over a 34-day period by Allen and Swindell
    (1948:12), but a complete fang-shedding cycle was not observed. Fitch
    (1960:110) reported a 33-day cycle in copperheads; Klauber (1956:726)
    estimated the normal active life of each fang of an adult rattlesnake to be
    from six to ten weeks, but he made no observations to confirm his estimation.</p>
<p>Fangs measured from the tip of the notch of the basal lumen to the end of
    the fang vary from about 1.3 per cent of the snout-vent length in juveniles to
    about 1.0 per cent in large adults (Table 6). The fangs are longer than those
    of copperheads (Fitch, 1960:111). Klauber's (1956:736) figures on fang-lengths
    in all species of rattlesnakes are percentages of total length rather than
    of the snout-vent length. The fangs of various species of rattlesnakes range
    from nearly the same proportionate length as those of cottonmouths to some
    much longer.</p>
<p>From patterns of bites of venomous snakes, Pope and Perkins (1944:333-335)
    attempted to correlate number, size, and patterns of tooth marks with
    size and generic identity of the snake responsible for the bite. Distance between
    fangs is relatively constant for snakes of a particular size (Table 6) regardless
    of genus, but the fangs of a cottonmouth are directed outward to
    variable degrees, and puncture wounds could easily resemble those of a much
    larger snake (Table 7). Also there is no direct relationship between size of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span> snake and toxicity or amount of venom injected. Consequently information of
    this kind is of little or no value from a medical standpoint.</p>

<h2>HABITAT AND LIMITING FACTORS</h2>
<p>Although usually associated with swamps and lowlands along river bottoms,
    the cottonmouth lives in a variety of habitats ranging from salt marshes to cool,
    clear streams and from sea level to an altitude of 2300 feet. Shaded, moist
    areas either in or beside shallow waters are preferred, but cottonmouths occasionally
    wander as far as a mile from water.</p>
<p>In the pine-oak forests of Nacogdoches County in eastern Texas cottonmouths
    and copperheads are probably the most abundant species of snakes.
    Specimens have been collected near Nacogdoches in ponds, swamps, clear and
    fast-running streams with rock bottoms, and sluggish muddy streams. On the
    Stephen F. Austin Experimental Forest numerous cottonmouths live in a
    swamp until around mid-July, when it becomes dry. A small stream west of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span> the swamp seems to be used as a migration route to and from the swamp.
    Slightly more than a mile downstream cottonmouths are common in a bottomland
    area. The ground is always moist and no undergrowth occurs; a few
    small clear springs produce shallow trickles that run into a swamp. Cottonmouths
    can often be found here, lying in or beside the small trickles.</p>
<p>I have seen cottonmouths in various types of aquatic habitats in Brazoria
    County. In most places in this area, cottonmouths are found in association
    with one or more species of water-snakes (including <i>Natrix cyclopion</i>, <i>N.
    erythrogaster</i>, <i>N. rhombifera</i>, and <i>N. confluens</i>), which greatly outnumber the
    cottonmouth. Interspecific competition may be reduced somewhat by cottonmouths
    sometimes feeding on water-snakes.</p>
<p>The numerous statements in the literature concerning the habitat of the
    cottonmouth can be summarized most easily by the following short quotations:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p><i>Agkistrodon piscivorus piscivorus</i>&mdash;&quot;Marshes and lakes; ponds and streams
        with wooded shores; low country near water; roadside ponds; drainage ditches;
        coastal 'banks'; keys; some Gulf coast islands; mangrove swamps.&quot; (Wright
        and Wright, 1957:919.)</p>
    <p><i>Agkistrodon piscivorus leucostoma</i>&mdash;&quot;Cypress, gum, river swamps; alluvial
        swamps wooded or not wooded; water courses of the south such as rivers,
        bayous, backwaters of small branches; hill streams in the north; ...
        marshy places in prairies ... rice fields, bottomland pools; margins of
        above habitats, pools, shallow lakes, swampy places, temporary flood lands.
        ... In, under, or on fallen timber, in holes in banks, rocky bluffs, crayfish
        burrows. In short it is very aquatic.&quot; (Wright and Wright, <i>op. cit.</i>:923.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Geographically cottonmouths differ somewhat in their ecological requirements,
    but are basically much alike in most respects. The areas of greatest
    abundance are those having 40 inches or more of annual rainfall. The northern
    edge of the range has a mean temperature of approximately 38&deg; F. in January
    in Virginia and 30&deg; F. in Missouri, although the lowest temperature reached
    in these areas is more important as a limiting factor. The annual rainfall in
    both Virginia and Missouri amounts to approximately 40 inches. Moisture,
    as well as temperature, may play an important role in the northward distribution
    of the species. The eastern cottonmouth seems to be less tolerant of low
    temperatures than the western subspecies. Mean January temperatures equal
    to those along the northern limits of the western cottonmouth's distribution
    are reached in the vicinity of Connecticut, which is north of the geographic
    range of the eastern subspecies.</p>
<p>The depths to which cottonmouths penetrate into their dens may have a
    limiting influence upon the geographic range, especially in the northern extremes.
    Bailey (1948:215) discussed the possibility that populations of snakes
    may be significantly depressed because of winter kill of individuals that &quot;hibernate&quot;
    at shallow depths. He speculated also that the short growing season
    does not allow enough time for the essentials of existence to be carried out,
    and the prolonged period of inactivity overtaxes the energy reserve of the
    species.</p>
<p>Available food does not seem to be of much importance as a limiting factor,
    for the cottonmouth is remarkably indiscriminate in its choice of prey, feeding
    upon almost any vertebrate animal that happens to come within reach. Competition
    for food, however, may play an important role.</p>

<h2>REPRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>Courtship and Mating</h3>
<p>A review of available literature indicates no records of courtship of the
    cottonmouth other than statements that breeding occurs in early spring. In
    a close relative, the copperhead (see Fitch, 1960:159-160), mating occurs
    almost any time in the season of activity but is mainly concentrated in the
    few weeks after spring emergence, at about the time when females are ovulating.
    Klauber (1956:692) concluded that along the southern border of the
    United States rattlesnakes normally mate in spring soon after coming out of
    their winter retreats; but farther north where broods are produced biennially,
    the mating times may be more widely dispersed, and summer and fall matings
    may even predominate.</p>
<p>The only record of copulation in the cottonmouth was reported by Allen
    and Swindell (1948:11), who observed a pair copulating for three hours on
    October 19, 1946, at the Ross Allen Reptile Institute. Davis (1936:267-268)
    stated that courtship in cottonmouths is violent and prolonged but did not
    note any nervous, jerky motions or nudging of the female along her back and
    sides as had been observed in other genera of snakes. Carr (1936:90) saw
    a male cottonmouth seize a female in his mouth and hold her, but no courtship
    followed.</p>
<h3>Reproductive Cycles</h3>
<p>Many persons have assumed that gestation periods in snakes are the intervals
    between mating and parturition, and that mating and ovulation occur at approximately
    the same time. However, retention of spermatozoa and delayed
    fertilization indicate that copulation is not a stimulus for ovulation.</p>
<p>A biennial reproductive cycle was found for the copperhead in Kansas
    (Fitch, 1960:162), the prairie rattler in Wyoming (Rahn, 1942:239) and in
    South Dakota (Klauber, 1956:688), the great basin rattler in Utah (Glissmeyer,
    1951:24), and the western diamondback rattler in northwestern Texas (Tinkle,
    1962:309). Klauber's (1956:687) belief that the reproductive cycle of rattlesnakes
    varies with climate, being biennial in the north and annual in the
    south, is supported by similar climatic variation in the reproductive cycle of
    the European viper which was discussed by Vols&oslash;e (1944:18, 149).</p>
<p>If data for a large number of females were arranged as are those in Table 8,
    they might reveal whether the breeding cycle is annual or biennial. The figures
    presented in Table 8 are misleading if viewed separately because of the small
    number of individuals included in some of the size classes.</p>
<p>The smallest reproductive female found measured 455 millimeters in snout-vent
    length. Conant (1933:43) reported that a female raised in captivity
    gave birth to two young at an age of two years and ten months. The size
    classes represented by gravid females found by Barbour (1956:38) in Kentucky
    indicate that breeding occurs at least by the third year.</p>
<p>The ovaries of female cottonmouths examined revealed ova in various stages
    of development. In individuals less than 300 millimeters in snout-vent length
    the ovaries are almost completely undeveloped; in immature individuals from
    300 to 450 millimeters in length the follicles are from one to two millimeters
    in length; in post-post females follicles vary in size, the largest being about
    seven millimeters. Reproductive females also contain follicles of various sizes. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span> One or two sets are less than three millimeters in length, and large ova that
    soon are to be ovulated are present. Ovarian ova found in April ranged in
    length from 23 to 35 millimeters. No embryonic development was observed
    in most individuals until June or later.</p>

<p>Increase in length of testes appears to be correlated with length of the
    individual rather than cyclic reproductive periods (Fig. 4).</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/i_453.jpg" alt="Fig. 4. Length of testes in cottonmouths of various sizes" height="315" width="500" /> <span class="caption">Fig. 4. Length of testes in cottonmouths of various sizes <br />
    (<span class="xlfont"> &middot;</span>&mdash;left; </span> <span class="lfont">&deg;</span><span class="caption">&mdash;right ). The right testis is always longer than
    the left. </span></div>
<p>The reproductive cycle in cottonmouths resembles that illustrated by Rahn
    (<i>op. cit.</i>:237), in which the ovarian follicles of post-partum females begin to
    enlarge in late summer and autumn, with ovulation occurring the following
    spring. By means of retaining sperm successive broods possibly are produced
    after only one mating. In captivity, at least, some females may not follow
    this biennial cycle; Stanley Roth (M.S.), biology teacher in high school at
    Lawrence, Kansas, had a female of <i>A. p. piscivorus</i>, from Florida, that produced
    broods of 14 and 12 young in two consecutive years.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span></p>
<h3>Embryonic Development</h3>
<p>After ova are fertilized a three and one-half to four-month period of development
    begins which varies somewhat depending on the temperature. In
    almost every instance the ova in the right uterus outnumber those in the left.
    Embryos usually assume the serpentine form in the latter part of June and
    are coiled in a counterclockwise spiral with the head on the outside of the
    coil. At this time the head is relatively large and birdlike in appearance with
    conspicuous protruding eyes. Sex is easily noted because the hemipenes of
    males are everted. By late July scales are well developed and the embryo is
    more snakelike in appearance, but pigmentation is still absent. By mid-August
    the color and pattern are well developed, the egg tooth is present, the snake
    shows a considerable increase in size over that of the previous month, and
    much of the yolk has been consumed. Some females that contain well developed
    embryos also contain eggs that fail to develop. Sizes of ova vary
    irrespective of size of female and stage of embryonic development. Lengths
    of ova ranged from 22 to 51 millimeters in May to 35 to 49 millimeters in
    July and August. A two-yolked egg was found in one female.</p>
<h3>Birth of Young</h3>
<p>Accounts in the literature of 15 litters of cottonmouths fix the time of
    birth as August and September. Conant (1933:43) reported the birth of a
    litter in mid-July by a female that had been raised in captivity, and one female
    that I had kept in captivity for two months gave birth to a litter between
    October 19 and October 25. The conditions of captivity undoubtedly affected
    the time of birth in both instances.</p>
<p>Wharton (1960:125-126) reported the birth and behavior of a brood of
    seven cottonmouths in Florida. I was given notes of a similar nature by
    Richard S. Funk of Junction City, Kansas, on a brood of five cottonmouths.
    The mother of the brood was caught in June, 1962, in Tarrant County, Texas,
    by Richard E. Smith, and was 705 millimeters in snout-vent length. The first
    young was found dead in an extended position a few inches from the fetal
    membranes at 11:05 p.m. on August 22. The second young was born at
    11:07 p.m. The intervals between the successive births were three, seven,
    and four minutes; and time until the sac was ruptured in each instance was
    six, five, eight, and 11 minutes. The time interval between the rupture of the
    sac and emergence of each individual was 41, 92, 154, and 34 minutes. The
    mother's actions in giving birth to the last four young were essentially as
    described by Wharton (<i>loc. cit.</i>), except that the intervals between successive
    births did not increase. Within one minute after rupturing the sac and while
    its head was protruding, each of the four living young opened its mouth
    widely from three to seven times, then took its first breath. Breaths for the
    first three hours were steady at three or four per minute but then decreased
    to two or three per minute. Pulse rate for the four averaged 38 per minute
    while at rest but increased to 44 per minute after voluntarily crawling.</p>
<h3>Number of Young per Litter</h3>
<p>Records of from one to 16 young per litter have been reported (Ditmars,
    1945:330; Clark, 1949:259), but the average is probably between six or seven.
    Most accounts in the literature present information on number of ova or embryos <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span> per female rather than the number of young. Size and age of the
    mother (Table 9) influence the number of ova produced. Allen and Swindell
    (1948:11) recorded three to 12 embryos in 31 cottonmouths varying in total
    length from 26 to 44 inches. An average of 6.5 embryos per female was
    found.</p>

<p>Mortality at birth has been recorded for almost every litter born in captivity
    (see Allen and Swindell, <i>loc. cit.</i>; Conant, 1933:43; Wharton, 1960:125).
    A female that I kept in captivity gave birth to seven young. Three never
    ruptured their sacs, and another died soon after leaving the sac. The effects
    of captivity on females may result in higher rates of deformity and mortality
    in young than is common in nature. Klauber (1956:699-700) estimated that
    the defects brought about by conditions of captivity on rattlesnakes eliminate
    about three young per litter.</p>
<h3>Population Composition</h3>
<p>No investigator has yet analyzed the composition of a population of cottonmouths
    according to age, sex and snout-vent length. Barbour (1956:35) did
    sort 167 snakes into size classes, but did not determine sex ratio, size at sexual
    maturity, reproductive cycles, or snout-vent length. He recorded total lengths
    from which snout-vent lengths cannot be computed because of differential
    growth rates and different bodily proportions of the two sexes. I judge from
    my findings that he included immature individuals in his three smallest size
    classes (45.5 per cent of the population). I found at least 32.5 per cent immature
    individuals (Fig. 5) in my material, but it was not a natural population.</p>
<p>The sex ratios of several small collections from natural populations varied,
    and no conclusions could be drawn. Females comprised 53 per cent of the
    specimens included in Fig. 5 and in a group of 48 embryos which represented
    eight broods. That percentage may not be the percentage in a natural population
    but is used in making assumptions because I lack better information.</p>
<h3>Reproductive Potential</h3>
<p>If data in Fig. 5 are representative of a natural population and if 61 per
    cent of the females are sexually mature, the reproductive potential can be
    estimated as follows: assuming a cohort of 1000 cottonmouths contains 530
    females, 61 per cent of the females (323 individuals) probably are adults.
    If 42 per cent of these females produce 6.5 young per female in any season
    (Tables 8 and 9), 136 females will produce 884 young. But if 50 per cent <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span> of the adult females are reproductive (as would be assumed if reproduction
    is biennial), 1050 young will be produced. Actually the number of young
    required per year to sustain a population is unknown, because mortality rates
    at any age are unknown.</p>

    study. Individuals less than 450 millimeters in snout-vent length
    are considered as immature. Specimens from 200 to 249 millimeters
    in length are included in the 200-millimeter class, <i>etc.</i></span> </div>

<h2>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<h3>Size at Birth and Early Growth</h3>
<p>Size at birth depends on the health of the mother. According to Fitch
    (1960:182), many litters of copperheads born in captivity are stunted. Seven
    young cottonmouths (two males and five females) born in captivity were each
    185 millimeters in snout-vent length and 40 millimeters in tail length. Weights
    of the three living young were 10.0, 10.1, and 11.1 grams. Another litter of
    five young measured by Richard S. Funk were larger, and differences in the
    proportions of the tail length and snout-vent length suggest the sexual dimorphism
    found in larger individuals. However, sex of these young snakes
    was not recorded. Snout-vent length and tail length in millimeters were 232,
    41; 243, 47; 229, 40; 240, 48; and 225, 40 in the order of their birth. These
    snakes are considerably smaller than the nine young of <i>A. p. piscivorus</i> reported
    by Wharton (1960:127) that averaged 338 millimeters total length and 28.7
    grams. The yolk of one young <i>piscivorus</i> was 11.7 per cent of the total weight. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span> Yolk is used up in about two weeks if its rate of utilization resembles that of
    the copperhead as reported by Gloyd (1934:600).</p>
<p>Early rates of growth of three living young are shown in Table 10. On
    the 56th day after birth, each was fed one minnow less than two inches long.
    Between the 80th and 120th days three additional small minnows were fed
    to each snake. Young cottonmouths increase nearly 50 millimeters in length
    by the first spring if they inhabit warm areas and feed in autumn or winter.</p>
<p>Variation in size of newborn cottonmouths may be less in nature than in
    captivity. Average size at birth can be determined accurately by the size of
    young captured in early spring, at least in northern parts of the range where
    winter feeding and growth do not occur at all or are negligible. Total lengths
    of 19 juveniles thought by Barbour (1956:38) to be seven to eight months old
    do not differ markedly from lengths of the five newly-born young measured by
    Funk.</p>

<h3>The Umbilical Scar</h3>
<p>The umbilical cord is broken at birth and the navel closes within a few
    days; but the scar, involving from two to four ventral scales, remains throughout
    life. Position of the scar was found by Edgren (1951:1) to be sexually
    dimorphic in the eastern hog-nose snake (<i>Heterodon platyrhinos</i>), but nothing
    has been published on this matter concerning the cottonmouth. Consequently,
    I counted the scales of several individuals from the anal plate, and there was
    no marked difference in the position of the scar in males and females; it varied
    in position from the 10th to the 18th scale. When counted from the anterior
    end, the scar ranged from ventral number 115 to 122 (average, 119) in 28
    females and from number 117 to 126 (average, 121) in 14 males. The difference
    between male and female cottonmouths is not nearly so great as in <i>Heterodon</i>.</p>
<h3>Later Growth and Bodily Proportions</h3>
<p>The only records of growth increments in a natural population of cottonmouths
    are those in Table 11. The period of growth is mostly the period of
    activity, and differences are expected between northern and southern populations.
    As size increases, determination of growth rate becomes more difficult
    because age classes overlap in size. Growth of any individual depends not
    only on climate and food but also on disease and parasitism and the innate <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span> size potential. Stabler (1951:91) showed weight and length relationships in
    two cottonmouths for a period of six and one-half years.</p>

<p>My study failed to reveal any secondary sexual difference in growth rate
    and maximum size. Of the 306 cottonmouths measured by me, 16 males and
    five females exceeded 700 millimeters in snout-vent length. Two males were
    more than 850 millimeters long. One cottonmouth lived in captivity for 18
    years and 11 months (Perkins, 1955:262). The maximum total lengths were
    reported by Conant (1958:186-187) to be 74 inches (1876 mm.) in <i>A. p.
    piscivorus</i> and 54 inches (1370 mm.) in <i>A. p. leucostoma</i>.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"> <img src="images/i_458.jpg" alt="Fig. 6. Head length ( ? ) and head width ( ? )" height="328" width="500" /> <span class="caption">Fig. 6. Head length (<span class="lfont"> &deg; </span>) and head width ( <span class="xlfont"> &middot; </span>) expressed as a percentage

    was measured from the tip of the snout to the posterior end of the mandible.
    Head width was measured across the supraocular scales, since accuracy was
    greater than if measured at the posterior edge of the jaw. No sexual dimorphism
    or geographical variation occurs in these characters.</span> </div>
<p>Proportions of various parts of the body vary considerably depending on
    age, size and, in some instances, sex. Heads are proportionately larger in
    young than in adults (Fig. 6), as is true of vertebrates in general. This
    larger head has survival value for the cottonmouth in permitting more venom <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span> to be produced and in permitting it to be injected deeper than would be the

    case if the proportions were the same as in adults. Relative to the remainder
    of the snake the head is considerably larger than in the copperhead (Fitch,
    1960:108) and slightly larger than in the rattlesnake, <i>Crotalus ruber</i> (Klauber,
    1956:152).</p>

<p>In general, tails are relatively longer in males than in females of the same
    size (Fig. 7), except that there is little or no difference at birth. Growth of
    the tail in males proceeds at a more rapid rate. In certain individuals sex
    cannot be recognized from length of the tail relative to snout-vent length because
    overlapping occurs, especially in medium-sized individuals. Similar
    changes of proportions with increase in age occur in copperheads (Fitch, 1960:106)
    and rattlesnakes (Klauber, 1956:158-159), but the tail of the cottonmouth
    is relatively much longer.</p>

<h2>SHEDDING</h2>
<h3>The Shedding Operation</h3>
<p>Shedding of the skin is necessary to provide for growth and wear in snakes.
    The milkiness or bluing of the eyes, which causes partial blindness, marks the
    initial stage of shedding and is caused by a discharge of the exuvial glands that
    loosens the old <i>stratum corneum</i> from the layer below. In four to seven days
    the opaqueness disappears, and the snake sheds after an additional three to six
    days (Table 12). Young snakes first shed within a few days after birth and
    generally shed more frequently than adults, but the interval is variable. The
    eyes of three young cottonmouths observed by Wharton (1960:126) became
    milky on the fourth day but cleared on the seventh day, and the skin was
    shed on the eighth day. The eyes of three young kept by me became milky
    two to three days after birth, cleared on the seventh to tenth days, and the
    skin was shed on the thirteenth day. Possibly the relatively long interval in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span> this instance resulted from low relative humidity in the room where the
    snakes were kept. According to Fitch (1960:134), litters of young copperheads
    usually shed within three to ten days after birth; but under unusually
    dry conditions shedding did not occur for several weeks.</p>

</div>
<p>Cottonmouths as well as other snakes usually do not feed until after the
    skin is shed and are generally quiescent during the period preceding shedding,
    except that immediately before shedding they become active and rub their
    snouts on some rough object and may yawn several times seemingly in an
    attempt to loosen the skin along the edges of the lips. After the skin is
    loosened from the head, more rubbing against rough surfaces and writhing
    serves to pull the old skin off, turning it inside out. Once the old skin has
    passed over the thick mid-body, the snake often crawls forward using rectilinear
    locomotion until the skin is completely shed. It normally comes off in
    one piece; but, if the snake is unhealthy or has not had sufficient food or
    water, the skin may come off in patches. Frequently one or both of the
    lens coverings are not shed immediately and impair the sight. Bathing or
    swimming ordinarily causes dried skin to peel off; and, because of the cottonmouth's
    aquatic habits, its chances of shedding successfully are much greater
    than those of less aquatic snakes. Cottonmouths that have recently shed
    have bright and glossy patterns, in contrast to the dull and dark appearance
    of those that are preparing to shed.</p>
<h3>Frequency of Shedding</h3>
<p>Most of our knowledge concerning the frequency of shedding is based
    upon observations of captives. It is known that the intervals between exuviations
    are largely dependent upon the amount of food taken and the rate of
    growth. Unless laboratory conditions closely resemble those in the field,
    shedding frequencies in captives probably differ much from those of free-living
    snakes.</p>
<p>Only two of my captives shed twice. The intervals between exuviations <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span> in the two snakes were eight and five months, lasting from August to April
    and from December to May, respectively. Ten other snakes shed once in
    the period from January through July. Stabler (1951:91) presented data
    concerning shedding of two cottonmouths kept 12 and 14 years in captivity.
    One shed 25 times in 12 years and the other shed 37 times in 14 years, giving
    an average of 2.1 and 2.6 per year, respectively. Neither of the snakes
    shed from December through March, but the period of shedding corresponded
    to the period of greatest activity and growth. In Florida, cottonmouths shed
    four to six times a year, according to rate of growth (Allen and Swindell,
    1948:7).</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>FOOD HABITS</h2>
<h3>Methods of Obtaining Prey</h3>
<p>Food is obtained by a variety of methods depending on the type of food,
    age of the cottonmouth, and possibly other factors. Some captives lie in
    ambush and others crawl slowly in active search. At the first cue of possible
    prey, either by sight, scent, or differential temperature detection by the pit,
    the snake appears to become alert and flicks its tongue out at fairly rapid
    intervals.</p>
<p>By means of the facial or loreal pit found in all crotalids, the snake is able
    to detect objects having temperatures different from that of the surroundings
    of the objects. In detecting prey the tongue acts to sharpen the sense of
    &quot;smell&quot; by conveying particles to Jacobson's organs in the roof of the mouth.
    On many occasions cottonmouths appeared to rely solely on sight; they
    passed within a few inches of prey, apparently unaware of its presence until
    it moved. When pools of water begin to dry up toward the end of summer,
    cottonmouths often congregate and feed on dying fish. In these instances
    the fish are usually taken as they come to the surface. In laboratory observations
    moccasins seize live fish and some moccasins carry the fish until they
    have received lethal doses of venom; afterward the fish are swallowed. But
    grasping and manipulation of the prey occurs without the fangs' being employed,
    especially in the case of dead fish. On one occasion a cottonmouth
    was observed to grasp the edge of a glass dish that had contained fish and
    apparently retained the odor. On another occasion I placed several fish in a
    bowl, rubbed a stick on the fish, and then touched each snake lightly on the
    nose with the stick. The snakes crawled directly to the bowl and began
    feeding. At other times these same snakes crawled around the cage in an
    apparent attempt to locate the food but paid little attention to fish held in
    front of them. If the catching of prey under natural conditions were as
    uncoordinated as it sometimes is in captivity, the snakes probably would not
    be able to survive.</p>
<p>Wharton (1960:127-129) described tail-luring in one individual of a 76-day-old
    brood of cottonmouths. The snake lay loosely coiled with the tail
    held about six centimeters from the ground; a constant waving motion passed
    posteriorly through the terminal inch of the tail. These movements ceased
    at 7:20 p.m. but were resumed at 7:40 a.m. the following day. All observations
    were under artificial light. The &quot;caudal lure&quot; as a means of obtaining
    prey has been described in other species and related genera by Neill (1960:194)
    and Ditmars (1915:424).</p>
<p>Various authors have suggested that the method of capture differs according
    to the kind of prey. Allen and Swindell (1948:5) stated that cottonmouths
    retain their hold after striking fish or frogs but will release a mouse after
    delivering a bite and are timid in striking at larger rodents. Neill (1947:203)
    noted that a cottonmouth always waited several minutes after biting a large
    rat before approaching its prey. This same type of behavior has been reported
    for copperheads (Fitch, 1960:194) and rattlesnakes (Klauber, 1956:618). <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span> Cottonmouths observed by me retained a strong hold on fish, frogs, and
    sometimes mice, but almost always released large mice and baby chicks,
    which were not eaten until after death.</p>
<p>Different behavior according to type of prey is correlated with ability of
    prey to retaliate, although some animals may not be released because they
    could easily escape. For instance, a frog could hop far enough to escape in
    a matter of seconds if released. A 73-millimeter <i>Rana pipiens</i> that I observed
    was bitten twice within one and a quarter hours and died 45 minutes after
    the last bite. Its movement was uncoordinated by the time of the second bite,
    but it could have escaped had the frog not been confined. Although it is
    doubtful that normal, healthy fish are frequently captured by cottonmouths,
    Allen (1932:17) reported that a cottonmouth was seen pushing a small,
    dead pike about on the surface of a stream. A wound on the belly of the
    fish indicated that it had been bitten. A 17-gram creek chub (<i>Semotilus</i>)
    and a 13.7-gram bass (<i>Micropterus</i>) were injected by me with one-fourth
    cubic centimeter of fresh venom near the base of the tail in order to determine
    whether the fish could escape after being bitten and released. The creek
    chub flipped onto its back after a minute and 45 seconds and gill movements
    stopped in eight minutes and 35 seconds; the bass flipped over after 50 seconds
    and died in two minutes and 10 seconds. The venom immediately affected
    both fish, and it is unlikely that either could have swum more than a few feet.</p>
<p>After its prey has been killed, a cottonmouth examines the body from end
    to end by touching it with the tongue. Then the animal is grasped in the
    mouth without the use of the fangs and is slowly manipulated until one end
    (usually the head) is held in the mouth. The lengthy process of swallowing
    then takes place, the fangs and lower jaws alternately pushing the prey down
    the throat.</p>
<h3>Food and Food Preferences</h3>
<p>The cottonmouth seems to be an opportunistic omni-carnivore, because it
    eats almost any type of flesh that is available, including carrion. It feeds
    primarily upon vertebrates found in or near water; but invertebrates and
    eggs have also been found in the diet. The only potential prey items that
    seem not to be normally eaten are bufonid toads and tadpoles. I have
    occasionally offered tadpoles and frogs to cottonmouths, but only the frogs
    were accepted. But, Stanley Roth kept a cottonmouth in captivity that ate
    both toads and tadpoles. If tadpoles are commonly eaten, their probable
    rapid digestion would make identification almost impossible.</p>
<p>Following is a list of known foods of the cottonmouth:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Captivity: &quot;... rattlesnake.... The same moccasin also killed
        and ate a smaller snake of its own species....&quot; (Conant, 1934:382.)</p>
    <p>Florida: &quot;3 heron feathers, bird bone, <i>Eumeces inexpectatus</i>, 3 fish all under
        one inch in length, 1 heron egg shell&quot; (Carr, 1936:89). According to Allen
        and Swindell (1948:5), &quot;the food included other moccasins, prairie rattlesnakes,
        king-snakes, black snakes, water snakes, garter snakes, ribbon snakes,
        and horn snakes ... most of the species of frogs, baby alligators, mice,
        rats, guinea pigs, young rabbits, birds, bats, squirrels, and lizards ...
        a mud turtle ... a case of a four footer eating ten to twelve chicken
        eggs. The most common food appears to be fish and frogs. Catfish are
        included on this list....&quot; Yerger (1953:115) mentions &quot;an adult yellow
        bullhead, <i>Ameiurus natalis</i> ... 306 mm. in standard length [from a 63-inch
        cottonmouth].&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span></p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Georgia: &quot;... full grown <i>Rana catesbeiana</i>, several foot-long pickerel
        ... dead fish if placed in a pan of water.... <i>Natrix sipedon
        fasciata</i> and <i>Masticophis flagellum</i> ... rats.... Toads and large <i>Eumeces laticeps</i> were always ignored.&quot; (Neill, 1947:203.) &quot;<i>Natrix</i>, <i>Heterodon</i>, <i>Kinosternon</i>, <i>Rana</i>, <i>Hyla cinerea</i>, <i>Microhyla</i>, Microtine [<i>Pitymys pinetorum</i>].&quot;
        (Hamilton and Pollack, 1955:3.)</p>
    <p>Mississippi: &quot;... <i>Hyla gratiosa</i>.... In captivity specimens have
        eaten frogs, mice, birds, dead fish, pigmy rattlers and copperheads. Toads
        ... were refused&quot; (Allen, 1932:17). One moccasin &quot;disgorged a smaller
        decapitated moccasin ... killed the day before by boys&quot; (Smith and
        List, 1955:123).</p>
    <p>Tennessee: &quot;Beetles in one stomach; lizard (<i>Eumeces</i>) in another stomach;
        small snake (<i>Natrix</i>) in one intestine, and hair in another intestine. One
        stomach contained numerous bits of wood, up to four inches in length....&quot;
        (Goodman, 1958:149.)</p>
    <p>Kentucky: &quot;<i>Siren intermedia</i> was the most abundant food item in both
        volume and occurrence. Frogs of the genus <i>Rana</i> ranked second. Together,
        these two items comprised almost <span class="top">2</span>/<span
 class="bottom">3</span> of the food of the snakes. The other
        food items were distributed among the fishes, reptiles, and other amphibians
        [one <i>Rana</i> tadpole included].&quot; (Based on 42 samples&mdash;Barbour, 1956:37.)</p>

        ... but refuses leopard frogs.&quot; Trowbridge (1937:299) writes: &quot;several
        sun perch.... Another had eaten six catfish six to ten inches long
        ... a water snake (<i>Natrix s. transversa</i>) about 18 inches long ...
        frogs, mostly <i>Rana sphenocephala</i>.&quot; Carpenter (1958:115) mentions &quot;a
        juvenile woodthrush.... Seven last instar cicadas ... a young
        cottontail.&quot; According to Laughlin (1959:84), one moccasin &quot;contained the
        following items: 18 contour feathers of a duck, probably a teal; one juvenile
        cooter turtle, <i>Pseudemys floridana</i>; and a large mass of odd-looking unidentifiable
        material. The other cottonmouth contained one juvenile pond turtle, <i>Pseudemys scripta</i>....&quot;</p>
    <p>Texas: &quot;... several ... feeding on frogs.... One ...
        found DOR was found to contain a large catfish.&quot; (Guidry, 1953:54.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of 246 cottonmouths that I examined for food items, only 46 contained
    prey in their digestive tracts. Almost all of the snakes examined were
    museum specimens that had been collected at many places over a period
    of about 40 years. It was not known how long each had been kept alive
    before being preserved. Therefore it was impossible to determine what
    proportion of any population of cottonmouths could be expected to contain
    food. The food items were not analyzed numerically because the scales and
    hair, by means of which many food items in the intestine were identified,
    yielded no clue as to the number of individuals actually present unless several <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span> distinct kinds were found. Each occurrence of scales or hair was thus recorded
    as a single individual, although some such occurrences may have represented
    more than one animal. The contents of some stomachs were so well digested
    that it was difficult to determine the number of items present. As a rule
    only one food item was present in a digestive tract, but a few tracts contained
    several items of the same or different species. Three frogs (<i>Acris crepitans</i>)
    were in one snake and three hylas (<i>Hyla versicolor</i>) in another. Still another
    individual captured beside a drying pond contained six individuals of <i>Lepomis</i> each about three inches long and two pikes (<i>Esox</i>) about six inches long.</p>

<p>The &quot;unidentified&quot; category (Table 13) refers to jellylike masses in the
    stomach or material in the intestine in which no scales, feathers, hair, or bones <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span> could be found. Most of the unidentifiable matter could be assumed to
    consist of remains of amphibians, since they leave no hard parts. If this
    assumption is correct, amphibians comprise about 40 per cent of the diet.
    Since intestinal contents were included, a volumetric analysis was not feasible.
    Therefore, the weight of each type of food item was estimated and the
    percentage by bulk calculated from it (Table 13).</p>
<p>Pieces of dead leaves and small sticks constituted most of the plant material
    found and presumably were ingested secondarily because they adhered to the
    moist skin of the prey, especially to fish and amphibians. However, some
    plant materials probably are eaten because they have acquired the odor of
    the prey. One cottonmouth contained a <i>Hyla cinerea</i>, several leaves, and five
    sticks from 37 to 95 millimeters long and from 12 to 14 millimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>Most reports in the literature state that gravid females do not feed, but
    four gravid females examined by me containing large, well-developed embryos
    also contained evidences of having recently fed. Two of them had scales of
    snakes in the stomach or intestine, one contained a six-inch <i>Lepomis</i>, and the
    other had hair in the intestine and the head and neck of an adult egret in the
    stomach.</p>

<h2>MORTALITY FACTORS</h2>
<h3>Natural Enemies and Predators</h3>
<p>Published records of other animals preying on cottonmouths or killing them
    are few. Reptiles more often than other classes of vertebrates prey on the
    cottonmouth. McIlhenny (1935:44) reported on the scarcity of snakes in
    areas where alligators were present. Predation on cottonmouths by indigo
    snakes (<i>Drymarchon corais</i>) was reported by Conant (1958:153) and Lee
    (1964:32). Allen and Swindell (1948:6) obtained a photograph of a king-snake
    (<i>Lampropeltis getulus</i>) killing a cottonmouth but thought that moccasins
    are not eaten by <i>L. getulus</i>. However, one occasion reported herein shows that
    cottonmouths are eaten by king-snakes; and Clark (1949:252) reported finding
    13 cottonmouths, along with other prey, in the stomach contents of 301 king-snakes
    (<i>L. g. holbrooki</i>) from northwestern Louisiana. Cannibalism is also
    common among cottonmouths. Klauber (1956:1058;1079) cited predation
    on cottonmouths by a blue heron (<i>Ardea herodias</i>) and a largemouth bass
    (<i>Micropterus salmoides</i>). Man is probably the greatest enemy of the cottonmouth.
    Intentional killing, capturing, road kills, and alteration of the environment
    destroy large numbers.</p>
<h3>Parasites and Diseases</h3>
<p>Allen and Swindell (1948:12) listed several diseases and parasites of snakes
    and stated that &quot;some moccasins captured in the woods are so poor and weak
    from parasitic infection that they can barely crawl.&quot; The only kind of ectoparasite
    found on captive cottonmouths in the course of my study was a snake
    mite, <i>Ophionyssus natricus</i>. An infestation of that mite was thought to be
    partly responsible for the death of one captive moccasin. Other moccasins
    spent increasing amounts of time in their water dish after they became
    infected with mites. Under natural conditions frequent swimming probably
    keeps cottonmouths nearly free of mites.</p>
<p>Endoparasites found included lung flukes, stomach nematodes, and tapeworms.
    Lung flukes (<i>Ochetosoma</i> sp.) were found in 16 of 20 captive cottonmouths. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span> Snails and frogs serve as intermediate hosts for various stages in
    the life cycle of these flukes. The high percentage of cottonmouths infested
    with flukes is indicative of the use of frogs as a major source of food. Less
    than ten flukes were usually observed in the snakes' mouths but occasionally
    more were seen. One snake was observed thrashing about in its cage for
    nearly an hour, after which time it died. Upon examination of the mouth,
    32 flukes were found, most of which were located in the Jacobson's organs.
    Whether or not flukes caused the death is not known. Nematodes (<i>Kalicephalus</i> sp.) were found in the stomach of each of several preserved specimens;
    most of these snakes had no food in their digestive tracts. In a high percentage
    of the moccasins, tapeworms (<i>Ophiotaenia</i> sp.) were in the duodenum,
    in many instances so tightly packed as seemingly to prevent passage of food.
    The importance of fish in the diet is reflected by the high percentage of
    snakes containing tapeworms. An unidentified cyst (?) about an inch long
    and containing two hooks on one end was found attached to the outer wall
    of the stomach of a cottonmouth. Yamaguti (1958) listed all the kinds
    of helminths known from cottonmouths.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Causes of Death</h3>
<p>Munro (1949:71-72) reported on the lethal effect of 10 per cent DDT
    powder on two young cottonmouths which were dusted with it to kill mites.
    Herald (1949:117) reported an equal effect caused by spraying a five per cent
    DDT solution in a room with several snakes. All but three large cottonmouths,
    which were under shelter at the time of spraying, were killed.</p>
<p>One individual that refused to eat was dissected soon after death, and a
    short piece of a branch on which two large thorns were located at 90&deg; angles
    was found blocking the intestine at the posterior end of the stomach.</p>
<p>An unexpected and probably unusual circumstance caused the death of two
    captives. After cleaning a cage containing five cottonmouths and placing
    several mice in the cage for food, I noticed two of the snakes lying stretched
    out, partially on one side, and almost unable to move. At first I thought they
    had been bitten by other snakes which were in pursuit of the mice. The two
    died after two days. When a similar incident occurred in another cage, I
    removed the &quot;bitten&quot; snake and it fully recovered after 11 days. When
    the same symptoms were observed in a garter snake in another cage, I
    realized that in each instance the cage had been cleaned and fresh cedar
    chips placed in it immediately prior to observation of these symptoms. Fine
    cedar dust on the chips had evidently poisoned the snakes.</p>

<h2>BEHAVIOR</h2>
<h3>Annual and Diel Cycles of Activity</h3>
<p>In the days following emergence in spring, cottonmouths often endure uncomfortable
    and even dangerous temperatures in order to obtain food and
    mates. They are more sluggish at this time and more vulnerable to predation
    than later in the season when temperatures are optimal. Fitch (1956:463)
    found that copperheads in northeastern Kansas begin their annual cycle of
    activity in the latter part of April, when the daily maximum temperature is
    about 22&deg; C. and the minimum is about 4&deg; C., and become dormant in late <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span> October or early November, at which time the daily maximum temperature is
    about 15&deg; and the minimum is about 0&deg;. Indications are that in the northern
    part of its range the annual activity cycle of the cottonmouth resembles that
    of the copperhead in northeastern Kansas. Klimstra (1959:2) captured cottonmouths
    from April to October in southern Illinois. Barbour (1956:36) collected
    large numbers of them in early April in Kentucky and stated that they
    migrate from swamps to wooded hillsides in late August and early September.
    Spring migrations begin after a few consecutive warm days in March. In
    northern Oklahoma cottonmouths have been found along the Verdigris River
    as early as March, suggesting that a few winter in crayfish holes and mammal
    burrows. The majority of individuals found in this area were at denning sites
    along cliffs above the river and emerged later than those near the river (Dundee
    and Burger, 1948:1-2). In Virginia cottonmouths have been seen as early as
    March 5 (Martin and Wood, 1955:237) and as late as December 4. They
    have been observed in migration from the swamps of the barrier beach to the
    mainland in late October and early November in southeastern Virginia (Wood,
    1954a:159). According to Neill (1947:204), the cottonmouth tolerates lower
    temperatures than do most snakes in Georgia and is one of the last to go into
    hibernation. Allen and Swindell (1948:4) stated that cottonmouths usually
    bask during the mornings of the cooler months in Florida, but they mentioned
    nothing of denning such as occurs farther north. Although winter aggregations
    occur in the northern parts of the range, I have never seen such aggregations
    in the South. However, in one instance related to me by a reliable
    observer, seven cottonmouths were found together on a creek bank near the
    Gulf Coast in early spring.</p>
<p>During late summer and early autumn, fat is deposited in lobes in the lower
    abdomen in preparation for the period of winter quiescence. Gravid females
    usually do not feed so frequently or so much as other snakes, because they
    tend to become inactive as the ova develop. Whether or not females feed
    heavily after parturition and previous to denning is not known. Peaks of
    activity in autumn may be caused by final attempts to feed before denning
    and by the appearance of large numbers of newborn young. The young
    usually have from one to two months in which to feed before the advent of
    cold weather. According to Barbour's (<i>op. cit.</i>:38) findings, the young probably
    feed before hibernation because they grow substantially in winter. For
    those that do not feed, the rate of survival is perhaps much lower.</p>
<p>In preparation for winter, cottonmouths migrate inland, usually to dry
    forested hillsides where they den, commonly among rocks at the tops of bluffs,
    along with several other species of snakes. In such aggregations there is no
    hostility and each individual may derive benefit from contact with others by
    which favorable conditions of temperature and humidity are maintained.</p>
<p>Neill (1947:204) has found many specimens in winter by tearing bark from
    rotting pine stumps on hillsides overlooking lakes or streams. On cold days
    they evidently retreat below the surface, while on warm days they lie just
    below the bark or emerge and bask. Neill believes that the use of stumps by
    cottonmouths is an innate pattern of behavior, because of the large number
    of young-of-the-year found in such surroundings. Cottonmouths were observed
    in winter also under logs and stumps by Allen (1932:17). I have
    twice observed cottonmouths crawling into crayfish burrows along the Gulf
    Coast of Texas, and suppose they are used as denning sites to some extent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span></p>
<p>The diel cycle of activity of cottonmouths is of necessity closely related
    to the seasonal cycle. Since optimal temperatures determine activity, the
    diel cycle varies greatly from time to time. It has been well established
    that cottonmouths, like most other crotalids and many snakes of other families,
    prefer nocturnal to diurnal activity, even though the temperature may be
    less favorable at night. This preference is correlated with increased nocturnal
    activity of frogs and reptiles that constitute the principal food supply.</p>
<p>During spring and autumn, activity is more restricted to the day and long
    periods of basking occur. However, as hot weather approaches, basking
    occurs mainly in the morning and evening and activity becomes primarily
    nocturnal. But, in well shaded, moist forests, cottonmouths feed actively in
    the daytime.</p>
<p>Availability of food also has an important influence upon activity. Allen and
    Swindell (<i>op. cit.</i>:5) stated that moccasins congregate around drying ponds
    and feed on dying fish until the moccasins can hold no more. They then
    usually stay nearby as long as food remains. In an area of the Stephen F.
    Austin Experimental Forest near Nacogdoches, Texas, many cottonmouths
    journey daily to and from a swamp and a dry field, evidently to feed on
    rodents inhabiting the area. Ten individuals captured along a snake-proof
    fence that was built 30 yards from the swamp were found lying coiled along
    the fence after 4:30 p.m., at which time the area was shaded. On another
    occasion, I captured a large cottonmouth that was feeding upon dying fish
    in a drying pool about 10:30 a.m. on August 19, 1962.</p>
<p>Because of the aquatic habits of the cottonmouth, relative humidity probably
    has little influence on the snake's activity. However, cottonmouths are
    more restricted to the vicinity of water in dry weather than during rains or
    muggy weather when many of their natural prey species also move about
    more freely. Increased activity on cloudy days may result from protection
    from long exposure to sunshine. Torrential rains and floods, such as those
    following hurricanes along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern
    United States, bring out quantities of snakes of all species. Rattlesnakes and
    cottonmouths in particular are killed by the thousands at these times because
    they seek shelter in human habitations. However, these are unusual circumstances
    and do not reflect voluntary activity as a result of preferences.</p>
<p>Thermal reactions of reptiles were classified by Cowles and Bogert (1944)
    into several categories. For each species there is a basking and normal
    activity range limited by the voluntary minimum and voluntary maximum at
    which the animal seeks shelter. Beyond this normal range are the critical
    thermal minimum and critical thermal maximum (C. T. M.) at which effective
    locomotion is prevented. The lethal minimum and maximum are those
    temperatures at which short exposure produces irreparable damage, and death
    inevitably results. These classifications are modified somewhat by seasonal
    or laboratory acclimation or by the physiological state of the animal. The
    C. T. M. of five cottonmouths was determined by placing each individual
    in an enclosed area and heating it with an infrared lamp. Cloacal temperatures
    were taken with a Schultheis quick-recording thermometer as soon as
    the snake could no longer right itself when placed on its back. All temperatures
    were in degrees Celcius. The C. T. M. averaged 39.2&deg; (38.0&deg; to 40.0&deg;). A
    temperature of 38.0&deg; was lethal to one individual. These cottonmouths had <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span> been in captivity for nine months. The behavior of the snakes during heating
    resembled those instances described by Klauber (1956:382-387) for rattlesnakes.
    As the body temperature of the snakes rose past the optimum, each
    individual became disturbed and tried to escape from the enclosure. The
    snakes soon became frantic in their efforts to escape. After about five minutes
    the mouth was opened and heavy, slow breathing was begun, accompanied by
    a loss of coordination and a slowing down of movements. The snakes writhed
    spasmodically for a few seconds and then lay still, usually with the mouth
    open. Recovery was begun by rolling on the belly and flicking the tongue,
    followed by movements of the head and then the body. Cottonmouths are
    rarely exposed to dangerously high temperatures owing to their semi-aquatic
    habits, but there are probably occasions when individuals reach the C. T. M.
    for the species.</p>
<h3>Basking</h3>
<p>Since activity, digestion, and gestation depend upon adequate internal
    temperatures, there must be a process by which these temperatures are attained
    and for an appropriate time maintained. Basking is important in this respect.
    The cottonmouths prefer to lie in a coiled position and, during basking, can
    usually be found beside bodies of water or on branches of dead trees overhanging
    the water. They are good climbers and have a prehensile tail that is
    frequently employed in descending from small branches. Since cottonmouths
    are semi-aquatic and are often exposed to temperatures that are lower than
    those of the air, they either must bask more often than terrestrial snakes
    or tolerate lower temperatures. Length of the period of basking is determined
    not only by amounts of insolation and temperature but also by the size of the
    snake. A smaller snake can reach its optimum temperature more rapidly
    because of a higher surface-to-volume ratio. Another factor that may play
    a minor role in the rate of temperature change is the color of the snake. The
    wide variation in color of cottonmouths probably affects rates of heat increase
    and loss due to direct radiation. Slight hormonal control of melanophores
    described in snakes by Neill and Allen (1955) also may exert some influence
    on the length of time spent basking. No rates of temperature increase or
    decrease are available for cottonmouths.</p>
<h3>Coiling</h3>
<p>While inactive the cottonmouth spends most of its time lying in a coiled
    position with the tail outermost, with the body usually wound into about one
    and one-half cycles, and the head and neck in a reversed direction forming a
    U- or S-shaped loop. From this position the snake is able to make a short
    strike or a hasty getaway if necessary. In my opinion this position is used
    primarily for basking or resting and only secondarily for feeding. Most
    individuals appear to pursue their prey actively, not lying in ambush for the
    approaching prey to the extent that most other crotalids do.</p>
<p>Many of the cottonmouths that I kept in captivity were observed in a coiled
    position for periods up to three or four days. Under natural conditions, however,
    they are more active. Young cottonmouths are inclined to remain in a
    coiled position for longer periods than older individuals.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>
<h3>Locomotion</h3>
<p>Four distinct types of locomotion have been described in snakes: horizontal
    undulatory, rectilinear, sidewinding, and concertina (Klauber, 1956:
    331-350). Most snakes are capable of employing two or more of these types
    of progression, at least to a certain degree; but horizontal undulatory locomotion
    is the most common method used by the majority of snakes, including
    the cottonmouth. In this method the snake's body is thrown into lateral
    undulations that conform with irregularities in the substrate. Pressure is
    exerted on the outside and posterior surface of each curve, thus forcing the
    body forward.</p>
<p>Rectilinear locomotion is more useful to large, thick-bodied snakes which
    use this method of progression, chiefly when they are prowling and unhurried.
    This method depends upon the movement of alternate sections of the venter
    forward and drawing the body over the ventral scales resting on the substratum
    by means of muscular action. This mode of locomotion was most
    frequently observed in captive cottonmouths when they were crawling along
    the edge of their cages, especially when they were first introduced to the cages
    and toward the end of the shedding process. The other two types of locomotion,
    sidewinding and concertina, have not, to my knowledge, been observed
    in the cottonmouth.</p>
<p>Both the cottonmouth and the cantil have definite affinities for water and
    are as likely to be found in water as out of it. Copperheads and rattlesnakes,
    although not aquatic, are good swimmers. When swimming, a motion resembling
    horizontal undulatory progression is used.</p>
<h3>Disposition</h3>
<p>The number of different opinions expressed in the literature concerning the
    cottonmouth's disposition is not at all surprising. As with any species there is
    a wide range of individual temperament, which is affected by many factors.
    The cottonmouth is considered by some writers to be docile while others consider
    it to be highly dangerous. Allen and Swindell (1948:7) described the
    variability in temperament, even among individuals. They wrote: &quot;On rare
    occasions, moccasins are found which will attack. A perfectly docile snake
    will turn and bite viciously without any apparent reason.&quot; They also recounted
    a case in which a cottonmouth was kept as a pet for six years, being
    allowed the freedom of the house. Smith and List (1955:123) found them
    &quot;... surprisingly docile in the gulf region [Mississippi], displaying none
    of the pugnacity of more northern cottonmouths.&quot; Smith (1956:310) stated:
    &quot;Unlike the copperhead, cottonmouths are pugnacious; their powerful jaws,
    long fangs, vicious disposition and potent venom make them a very dangerous
    animal.&quot;</p>
<p>My own observations are in general agreement with the statements of Allen
    and Swindell (<i>loc. cit.</i>). In my encounters with cottonmouths, I have never
    found any aggressive individuals except for three juveniles that were born in
    captivity. In their first three days in the laboratory these juveniles were observed
    to strike repeatedly whenever anyone entered the room. After this short
    period of aggressiveness, however, they slowly became more docile. The disposition
    shown by the newborn young is clearly an innate behavioral pattern
    that undoubtedly has a direct relationship to survival. The majority of cottonmouths <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span> that I have approached in the field have moved swiftly to seek refuge
    in nearby water; a few have remained motionless as I approached, and one
    showed the typical threat display. Upon capture and handling, they react
    similarly to other pit-vipers by opening and closing the mouth and erecting
    the fangs in an attempt to bite. They often bite through the lower jaw and
    eject venom at this time as well as when the mouth is open. Of more than a
    dozen individuals kept in captivity, four were particularly difficult to handle
    whereas another was extremely docile. It was almost never found in aggregations
    with the other snakes and did not struggle or attempt to bite when
    handled. The majority remained unpredictable in disposition, usually appearing
    docile and lazy but capable of extremely rapid movements when disturbed.</p>
<h3>Defense and Escape</h3>
<p>The typical threatening posture of rattlesnakes is all but lacking in the
    cottonmouth, which relies primarily on concealing coloration or nearness to
    water for escape. When approached, it usually plunges into nearby water or
    remains motionless with the head held up at a 45&deg; angle and the mouth
    opened widely exposing the white interior. The tail is sometimes vibrated
    rapidly and musk is expelled. This threat display is unique to cottonmouths;
    although it does not attract as much attention as the display of rattlesnakes,
    it is probably an effective warning to most intruders at close range.</p>
<p>Neill (1947:205) reported one case in which a cottonmouth used the &quot;body
    blow&quot; defense, described for <i>Crotalus</i> by Cowles (1938:13), when approached
    by a king-snake, <i>Lampropeltis getulus</i>. In this unusual posture the anterior
    and posterior portions of the body are held against the ground and the middle
    one-fourth to one-third of the body is lifted up and used in striking the
    intruder. This same defense posture also was observed in rattlesnakes when
    presented with the odor of the spotted skunk, <i>Spilogale phenax</i>. However, the
    &quot;king-snake defense posture&quot; is probably not a well-established behavioral
    pattern in the cottonmouth, for it sometimes feeds upon king-snakes. I observed
    the killing and devouring of a cottonmouth by a speckled king-snake, <i>L. g. holbrooki</i>; the only attempts to escape were by rapid crawling and biting.</p>
<p>Cottonmouths often squirt musk as a defensive action. The tail is switched
    back and forth, and musk is emitted from glands on each side of the base of
    the tail. The fine jets of musk are sprayed upward at about 45&deg; angles for a
    distance of nearly five feet. How often this defense mechanism is used against
    other animals is not known, but the musky odor can frequently be detected in
    areas where cottonmouths are common. The odor is repulsive and, if concentrated,
    can cause nausea in some individuals. To me, the scent is indistinguishable
    from that of the copperhead.</p>
<h3>&quot;Head Bobbing&quot;</h3>
<p>&quot;Head bobbing&quot; in snakes has been described frequently in the literature,
    and many interpretations have been advanced to explain its occurrence. One
    of the earlier accounts was that of Corrington (1929:72) describing behavior
    of the corn snake, <i>Elaphe guttata</i>. Characteristic bobbing occurred when the
    snake was cornered, and seemingly the purpose was to warn or frighten foes.
    Neill (1949:114-115) mentioned the jerking or bobbing of the head in several
    species of snakes including the cottonmouth, and remarked that &quot;it is apparently <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span> connected with courtship and with the recognition of individuals.&quot;
    According to Munro (1950:88), &quot;head bobbing&quot; appears to be a sign of
    annoyance in some instances but is usually concerned with reproduction and
    individual recognition. Richmond (1952:38) thought that many types of
    head movements among not only reptiles but also birds and some mammals
    are a result of poor vision and serve &quot;to delimit and orient an object that for
    lack of motion is otherwise invisible.&quot; Head movements undoubtedly occur
    in animals to facilitate accommodation, but it is obvious from Richmond's
    conclusions that he has never observed &quot;head bobbing&quot; in snakes. The term
    itself is grossly misleading and should be discarded. Mansueti (1946:98)
    correctly described the movements as spastic contractions of the body. I have
    observed numerous instances of these movements in cottonmouths, copperheads,
    and rat snakes (<i>Elaphe obsoleta</i>); and in no case has the movement
    resembled a head bob as is described in lizards and other animals. The movement
    appears to be a result of a nervous or sexually excited state and consists
    of highly spastic contractions confined to the anterior part of the snake most
    of the time but affecting the entire body on some occasions.</p>
<p>I found the response to be most common among cottonmouths in confinement
    when food was introduced to a cage containing several individuals
    (increasing the tendency to strike at a moving object) and when an individual
    was placed back in the cage after being handled. At these times the snakes
    that were inactive began to jerk for a few seconds. When the snake is in
    this seemingly nervous state, the same response is elicited by another snake
    crawling over it. At other times the movement of one individual causes no
    such response. The jerking movements appear to be released by the recognition
    of a nervous state in another individual and may serve to protect the
    jerking individual from aggressive advances of the former.</p>
<p>Where courtship is involved, the jerking motions are made in conjunction
    with writhing of the male and do not result from the same type of releaser
    described above.</p>
<h3>Combat Dance</h3>
<p>The so-called combat dance between male snakes has long been known,
    but its significance is still poorly understood. It was for many years believed
    to be courtship behavior until the participants were examined and found to
    be males. Carr and Carr (1942:1-6) described one such instance in two
    cottonmouths as courtship. In their observations, as well as those of others,
    copulation was never observed following the &quot;dance&quot; but was assumed to be
    the ultimate goal. After the discovery that only males participated, it was
    suggested that combat involved competition for mates, but the &quot;dance&quot; has
    been observed at times other than the breeding season (Ramsey, 1948:228).</p>
<p>Shaw (1948:137-145) discussed the combat of crotalids in some detail but
    drew no conclusions as to the cause of the behavior. Lowe (1948:134) concluded
    with little actual evidence that combat among male snakes is solely
    for territorial purposes. Shaw (1951:167) stated that combat may occur as
    a possible defense against homosexuality. One case of homosexual mating
    among cottonmouths was reported (Lederer, 1931:651-653), but the incomplete
    description seems to be of normal courtship procedure except that the
    &quot;female&quot; tried to avoid the male. Two instances of combat observed between
    timber rattlesnakes (<i>C. h. horridus</i>) by Sutherland (1958:23-24) were definitely <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span> initiated because of competition for food. More observations are needed before
    the significance of the combat can be fully understood.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE VENOM</h2>
<h3>Properties of the Venom</h3>
<p>The venom and poison apparatus have developed primarily as a means of
    causing rapid death in small animals that are the usual prey. As a protective
    device against larger enemies, including man, the venom may have some
    value; but this was probably unimportant in the evolution of the poison
    mechanism. A secondary function of the venom is to begin digestion of tissues
    of the prey. Since food is swallowed whole, injection of digestive enzymes
    into the body cavity enhances digestion of the prey.</p>
<p>Kellogg (1925:5) described venom as a somewhat viscid fluid of a yellowish
    color and composed of 50 to 70 per cent proteins, the chief remaining components
    being water and carbohydrates, with occasional admixtures of abraded
    epithelial cells or saprophytic microorganisms. Salts, such as chlorides, phosphates
    of calcium, magnesium, and ammonium, occur in small quantities. Each
    of the components of snake venom has a different effect on the body of the
    victim. It was at first believed that there were two types of venoms:
    neurotoxic, which acts upon nervous tissue; and haemotoxic, which acts on
    blood and other tissues. It has since been found that venoms are composed
    of varying mixtures of both types. Fairley (1929:301) described the constituents
    of venom as: (1) neurotoxic elements that act on the bulbar and
    spinal ganglion cells of the central nervous system; (2) hemorrhagins that
    destroy the lining of the walls of blood vessels; (3) thrombose, producing
    clots within blood vessels; (4) hemolysins, destroying red blood corpuscles;
    (5) cytolysins that act on leucocytes and on cells of other tissues; (6) elements
    that retard coagulation of the blood; (7) antibactericidal substances;
    and (8) ferments that prepare food for pancreatic digestion. Elapid snakes
    tend to have more of elements 1, 4, and 6 in their venoms, while viperids and
    crotalids, of which the cottonmouth is one, have higher quantities of elements
    2, 3, and 5. Kellogg (<i>loc. cit.</i>) stated that venom of cottonmouths contains
    more neurotoxin than that of rattlesnakes and not only breaks down the nuclei
    of ganglion cells but also produces granular disintegration of the myelin sheath
    and fragmentation of the conducting portions of nerve fibers.</p>
<p>Thus, venoms contain both toxic elements and non-toxic substances that
    promote rapid spreading of the venom through the body of the victim. Jacques
    (1956:291) attributed this rapid spreading to the hyaluronidase content of
    venoms.</p>
<h3>Venom Yield and Toxicity</h3>
<p>One of the most important yet undeterminable factors of the gravity of
    snakebite is the amount of venom injected into the victim. Since this volume
    varies considerably in every bite, attempts have been made to determine the
    amount and toxicity of venom produced by each species of poisonous snake.
    Individual yield is so variable that a large number of snakes must be milked in
    order to determine the average yield. Even then there remains an uncertainty
    as to how this amount may compare with that injected by a biting snake.</p>
<p>Wolff and Githens (1939b:234) made 16 venom extractions from a group <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span> of cottonmouths in a two-year period. The average yield per snake fluctuated
    between 80 and 237 milligrams (actual weight), and toxicity measured as the
    minimum lethal dose for pigeons varied from 0.05 to 0.16 milligrams (dry
    weight). No decrease in yield or toxicity was evident during this period.
    Another group of cottonmouths from which venom was extracted over a
    period of five years also showed no decrease in yield or toxicity. Of 315 individual
    extractions the average amount obtained from each individual was
    0.55 cubic centimeters of liquid or 0.158 grams of dried venom (28.0 per cent
    solids). The minimum lethal dosage (M. L. D.) which was determined by
    injecting intravenously into 350-gram pigeons was found to be 0.09 milligrams
    (dry weight). Each snake carried approximately 1755 M. L. D.'s of venom.</p>
<p>The record venom extraction for the cottonmouth was 4.0 cubic centimeters
    (1.094 grams dried venom) taken from a five-foot snake which had been in
    captivity for 11 weeks and milked five weeks earlier (Wolff and Githens,
    1939a:52). The average yield of venom of cottonmouths is about three times
    the average yield reported for copperheads by Fitch (1960:256), a difference
    correlated with the greater bulk and relatively large head of the cottonmouth.</p>
<p>Allen and Swindell (1948:13) stated that cottonmouth venom rates third
    in potency, compared drop for drop to that of <i>Micrurus fulvius</i> and <i>Crotalus
    adamanteus</i>. Freshly dried cottonmouth venom tested on young white rats
    showed the lethal dose to be from 23 to 29 milligrams per kilogram of body
    weight. The venom of 11 one-week-old cottonmouths was found to be more
    potent than that of adult males. Githens (1935:171) rated <i>C. adamanteus</i> venom as being weaker than that of the copperhead (<i>A. contortrix</i>), which he
    rated only slightly lower than cottonmouth venom. The crotalids which he
    ranked more toxic than cottonmouths are: the Pacific rattlesnake (<i>C. viridis
    oreganus</i>) and the massasauga (<i>S. catenatus</i>). He found <i>A. bilineatus</i>, <i>C.
    durissus</i>, and <i>C. v. lutosus</i> to have the same toxicity as cottonmouths. Minton
    (1953:214) found that the intraperitoneal &quot;lethal dose 50&quot; (the dose capable
    of killing half the experimental mice receiving injections of it) was 6.36 milligrams
    per kilogram for copperheads. However, in later publications Minton
    (1954:1079; 1956:146) reported that the &quot;lethal dose 50&quot; for copperheads was
    25.65 milligrams. Approximately the same potency was determined for cottonmouths.
    Several rattlesnakes that he tested showed a higher toxicity than
    copperheads or cottonmouths.</p>
<p>Criley (1956:378) found the venom of copperheads to be 6.95, nearer
    Minton's earlier estimate, and rated cottonmouth venom as being twice as
    toxic as that of copperheads. The relative toxicities of other crotalids tested,
    considering the cottonmouth to be one unit, were: <i>C. basiliscus</i>, 0.3; <i>A. contortrix</i>,
    0.5; <i>C. viridis oreganus</i>, 1.4; <i>A. bilineatus</i>, 2.2; <i>C. adamanteus</i>, 2.3; <i>C. v.
    viridis</i>, 3.2; <i>C. durissus terrificus</i>, 27.5.</p>
<p>It can be seen from the above examples that toxicity of venoms and the
    resistance of the animal receiving an injection of venom is highly variable.
    Possibly the venom of each species of snake has greatest effect on animals of
    the particular group relied on for food by the snake. If that is so, the venom
    of cottonmouths would be expected to be more toxic when tested on fish,
    reptiles, and amphibians than on birds and mammals. Likewise, the venom
    of most species of rattlesnakes would be expected to be more virulent when
    injected into mammals than when injected into lower vertebrates. But, according
    to Netting (1929:108), species of rattlesnakes that prey on cold-blooded <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span> animals, which are less susceptible to venoms than warm-blooded
    animals, are thought to have highly toxic venoms. This explanation accounts
    for the powerful venom of <i>Sistrurus catenatus</i>; and, in this respect, venom of
    cottonmouths should be highly toxic also. However, no clear-cut trends have
    been shown in most cases. Allen (1937) injected 250-gram guinea pigs with
    4 milligrams of venom of various poisonous snakes. Survival time was recorded
    in order to indicate the relative potency of the venoms. Of 16 such tests <i>C.
    adamanteus</i> held places 1, 2, 3, 12, and 16; <i>Bothrops atrox</i> held places 4, 9,
    10, and 13; and <i>A. piscivorus</i> held places 5, 7, 8, and 15. Places 6, 11, and 14
    were held by three individuals of different species. No relationship to size
    or sex was indicated by the results of this experiment.</p>
<h3>Susceptibility of Snakes</h3>
<p>Numerous experiments have been conducted to determine the susceptibility
    of various snakes to venom. The majority of these experiments were performed
    to learn whether or not venomous snakes were immune to their own
    poison. Conant (1934:382) reported on a 30-inch cottonmouth that killed
    two Pacific rattlesnakes and another cottonmouth. One rattlesnake was bitten
    on the tail and the other on or near the head and partially swallowed. Gloyd
    (1933:13-14) recorded fatal effects to a rattlesnake from the bite of a cottonmouth.
    He also reported on the observations of three other crotalids bitten
    by themselves or other snakes, from which no harmful effects were observed.
    Allen (1937) injected several snakes with dried cottonmouth venom which
    was diluted with distilled water just before each injection. Four cottonmouths
    receiving 9, 18, 19, and 20 milligrams of venom per ounce of body weight survived,
    while another receiving 18.7 milligrams per ounce died after three hours.
    A specimen of <i>S. miliarius</i> receiving 8.3 milligrams per ounce died in about
    ten hours, while a <i>C. durissus</i> receiving 12.5 milligrams per ounce succumbed
    in 45 minutes. An alligator receiving 6 milligrams per ounce died in 14 hours.
    Even the snakes that survived showed some degree of swelling.</p>
<p>The studies of Keegan and Andrews (1942:252) show that king-snakes are
    sometimes killed by poisonous snakes. A <i>Lampropeltis calligaster</i> injected with <i>A. contortrix</i> venom (0.767 milligrams per gram) died five days following the
    injection. This amount was more than twice the amount of <i>A. piscivorus</i> venom injected into a <i>L. getulus</i> by Allen (1937) in which the snake showed
    no ill effects. Keegan and Andrews (<i>loc. cit.</i>) stated that success in overpowering
    and eating poisonous snakes by <i>Lampropeltis</i> and <i>Drymarchon</i> may be due
    to the ability to avoid bites rather than to immunity to the venom. However,
    Rosenfeld and Glass (1940) demonstrated that the plasma of <i>L. g. getulus</i> had an inhibiting effect on the hemorrhagic action on mice of the venoms of
    several vipers.</p>
<p>One of the more extensive studies on effects of venoms on snakes is that
    by Swanson (1946:242-249). In his studies freshly extracted liquid venom
    was used. His studies indicated that snakes are not immune to venom of
    their own kind or to closely related species. Copperhead venom killed copperheads
    faster than did other venoms but took more time to kill massasaugas,
    cottonmouths, and timber rattlers. However, most of the snakes were able to
    survive normal or average doses of venom although they are not necessarily
    immune to it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span></p>
<p>One of the major problems in comparing the data on toxicity of venom
    in studies of this type is that no standard method of estimating toxicity has
    been used. Swanson's (<i>loc. cit.</i>) amount of venom equalling one minim
    (M.L.D.?) ranged from 0.058 to 0.065 cubic centimeters. There were no
    different values given for each species, but the time that elapsed from injection
    of the venom to death represented the toxicity. There also was no attempt
    in his study to convert the amount of venom used into a ratio of the volume
    of venom per weight of snake, making the results somewhat difficult to interpret.
    Additional work in this field should provide for many injections into
    many individuals of several size classes. The studies to date have been on
    far too few individuals to allow statistical analyses to be accurate.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>THE BITE</h2>
<h3>Effects of the Bite</h3>
<p>Factors determining the outcome of snakebite are: size, health, and species
    of snake; individual variation of venom toxicity of the species; age and size
    of the victim; allergic or immune responses; location of the bite; and the
    amount of venom injected and the depth to which it is injected. The last
    factor is one of the most variable, owing to (1) character and thickness of
    clothing between the snake and the victim's skin, (2) accuracy of the snake's
    strike, and (3) size of the snake, since a large snake can deliver more venom
    and at a greater depth than can a small snake.</p>
<p>Pope and Perkins (1944) demonstrated that pit-vipers of the United States
    bite as effectively as most innocuous snakes and that a careful study of the
    bite may reveal the location of the pocket of venom, size of the snake, and
    possibly its generic identity (see Dentition). The bite pattern of the cottonmouth
    as well as the other crotalids showed the typical fang punctures plus
    punctures of teeth on both the pterygoid and mandible. Even so, a varying
    picture may be presented because from one to four fang marks may be present.
    At times in the fang-shedding cycle three and even four fangs can be in
    operation simultaneously.</p>
<p>Various authors have attributed death of the prey to the following causes:
    paralysis of the central nervous system, paralysis of the respiratory center,
    asphyxiation from clotting of the blood, stoppage of the heart, urine suppression
    due to crystallized hemoglobin in the kidney tubules, dehydration of
    the body following edema in the area of the bite, or tissue damage. Mouths
    of snakes are reservoirs for infectious bacteria, which are especially prolific in
    damaged tissue. Bacterial growth is aided by the venom which blocks the
    bactericidal power of the blood.</p>
<p>Three grades in the severity of snakebite (I, minimal; II, moderate; and
    III, severe) were described by Wood, Hoback, and Green (1955). Parrish
    (1959:396) added a zero classification to describe the bite of a poisonous
    snake in which no envenomation occurred. Grade IV (very severe) was
    added by McCollough and Gennaro (1963:961) to account for many bites
    of the eastern and western diamondback rattlesnakes.</p>
<p>The first symptom of poisonous snakebite is an immediate burning sensation
    at the site of the bite. Within a few minutes the loss of blood into the tissues
    causes discoloration. Swelling proceeds rapidly and can become so great as
    to rupture the skin. Pain is soon felt in the lymph ducts and glands. Weakness, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span> nausea, and vomiting may ensue at a relatively early stage. Loss of
    blood into tissues may spread to the internal organs. In conjunction with a
    rapid pulse, the blood pressure and body temperature can drop. Some difficulty
    in breathing can occur, especially if large amounts of neurotoxin are
    present in the venom. In severe cases the tension due to edema obstructs
    venous and even arterial flow, in which case bacteria may multiply rapidly in
    the necrotic tissue and gangrene can occur. Blindness due to retinal hemorrhages
    may occur. Symptoms of shock may be present after any bite.</p>
<h3>Treatment</h3>
<p>Perhaps one of the most important factors in the outcome of snakebite is
    the treatment. Because of the variable reactions to snakebite, treatment
    should vary accordingly. Many methods have been proposed for treating
    snakebite, and there is disagreement as to which is the best. The list of
    remedies that have been used in cases of snakebite includes many that add
    additional injury or that possibly increase the action of the venom. The use
    of poultices made by splitting open living chickens and the use of alcohol,
    potassium permanganate, strychnine, caffeine, or injection of ammonia have
    no known therapeutic value, and may cause serious complications. The most
    important steps in the treatment of snakebite are to prevent the spread of
    lethal doses of venom, to remove as much venom as possible, and to neutralize
    the venom as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>It is generally agreed that the first step in snakebite treatment should be
    to place a ligature above the bite to restrict the flow of venom, and also to
    immobilize the patient as much as possible. The ligature should be loosened
    at least every fifteen minutes. The next steps are sterilization of the skin and
    the making of an incision through the fang punctures. As pointed out by
    Stahnke (1954:8), the incision should be made in line with the snake's body
    at the time of the bite, so as to account for the rearward curvature of the fangs
    and possibly to reach the deposition of venom. Many instruction booklets
    and first-aid guides have specified the length and depth of incision to be
    made, but the actual size and depth of the cut should depend upon the location
    of the bite. An &quot;X&quot; cut or connection of the fang punctures is likely to
    facilitate the spread of the venom. No cut should be made that would sever
    a large blood vessel or ligament.</p>
<p>Extensive damage is often caused by well-meaning individuals whose attempts
    at first aid result in brutally deep incisions and tourniquets applied too
    tightly and for too long a period of time; the resultant damage in many instances
    exceeds that of the bite itself (Stimson and Engelhardt, 1960:165).
    Stimson and Engelhardt also think that time should be sacrificed to surgical
    cleanliness, and incisions should not be made if a hospital can be reached
    within an hour.</p>
<p>The ligature-cryotherapy (L-C) method proposed by Stahnke (1953) has
    been severely criticized by other workers. He stated that the ligature should
    be tight enough to restrict completely the flow of venom until the temperature
    of the area can be lowered sufficiently to prevent any action of the venom.
    After 10 minutes the ligature may be removed and the bitten area kept immersed
    in a vessel of crushed ice and water. If the envenomized member is
    to be treated for more than four hours (which is the case with almost all <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span> pit-viper bites), it should be protected by placing it in a plastic bag. The
    venom action should be tested after 12 or more hours. This consists of a brief
    warming period to determine whether or not the action of the venom can be
    felt. The patient should be kept warm at all times; and the warming at the
    termination of treatment should be done gradually, preferably by allowing
    the water to warm slowly to room temperature.</p>
<p>Advocates of the L-C method warn against making incisions unless they
    are absolutely necessary, the theory being that each cut permits additional
    bacterial infection and does little good in removing venom. However, McCollough
    and Gennaro (1963:963) demonstrated that, in bites where the
    fangs had only slightly penetrated the skin, more than 50 per cent of the
    venom was removed in some instances if suction was started within three
    minutes after the injection. With deeper injection the amount of venom
    recovered sometimes reached 20 per cent of the dose. Stahnke suggested that
    an incision be made at the site of the bite only after the site has been
    refrigerated for at least 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Stimson and Engelhardt (<i>loc. cit.</i>) stated that two constricting bands
    should be used between the bite and the body and that cracked ice in a cloth
    should be applied to the bite before reaching a hospital. In addition, they
    suggested the following procedure. Rings of incisions should follow the swelling,
    and suction should continue for several hours. After the edema has
    receded, the limb should be wrapped in a towel containing crushed ice.
    Antivenin should be given only in severe cases. Calcium gluconate and gas
    gangrene antitoxin as well as antibiotics are helpful.</p>
<p>The most recent and up-to-date summary of snakebite treatment is that by
    McCollough and Gennaro (1963). Following is a brief summary of their
    suggestions:</p>
<p>1. Immobilization&mdash;Systemic immobilization is effected by body rest and
    locally by splinting the bitten area.</p>
<p>2. Tourniquet&mdash;A lightly occlusive tourniquet during a 30- to 60-minute
    period of incision and suction would seem to possess some advantages. In
    severe cases where medical attention is hours away, a completely occlusive
    tourniquet may be necessary to prevent death. Sacrifice of the extremity may
    be necessary for the preservation of life.</p>
<p>3. Incision and suction&mdash;Suction should begin three to five minutes after
    injection of venom if symptoms of poisoning are present. Incisions one-fourth
    inch to an inch long across each fang mark should be made in order to open
    the wound for more efficient suction. Multiple incisions are not useful for the
    removal of venom but may be employed under hospital conditions to reduce
    subcutaneous tensions and ischemia.</p>
<p>4. Cryotherapy&mdash;An ice cap over the site of the bite for relief of pain
    would seem to be permissible, especially prior to the administration of antivenin.
    It must be remembered that cooling during the administration of the antivenin
    radically reduces the access of the antiserum to the bite area.</p>
<p>5. Antivenin&mdash;Antiserum is the keystone to the therapy of snakebite. Careful
    evaluation of the severity of the bite and the patient's sensitivity should be
    made before the use of antivenin. In Grade II (moderate) bites, the intramuscular
    injection on the side of the bite may suffice. In Grades III (severe)
    and IV (very severe), shock and systemic effects require intravenous injection.
    In bites producing symptoms of this severity, antivenin must be given in <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span> amounts large enough to produce clinical improvement. Ten to 20 units may
    be necessary to prevent the relapse that sometimes occurs after small doses
    of antivenin. Permanent remission of swelling and interruption of necrosis are
    the therapeutic end point in the clinical use of the antiserum.</p>
<p>In all cases of snakebite where there is any doubt as to the snake's identity,
    it should be killed if possible and taken to the hospital for positive identification.
    In many instances of actual bites by poisonous snakes the only treatment
    needed was an injection of tetanus antitoxin or toxoid and sedation, because
    physical examination revealed no indication of poisoning (Stimson and Engelhardt, <i>loc. cit.</i>).</p>
<h3>Case History of a Bite</h3>
<p>On July 29, 1963, at 8:20 a.m., I was treating a nine-month-old cottonmouth
    for mites. As I dropped the snake into a sink, it twisted its head and
    bit the tip of my right middle finger with one fang. The fang entered just
    under the fingernail and was directed downward, the venom being injected
    about five millimeters below the site of fang penetration. After placing the
    snake back in its cage, I squeezed the finger once to promote bleeding, wrapped
    a string around the base of the finger, and drove to Watkins Memorial Hospital
    on the University of Kansas campus. I began to feel a burning sensation in the
    tip of the finger almost immediately. Upon my arrival at the hospital, an additional
    ligature was placed around my wrist. At 8:30 a.m. a small incision
    was made in the end of the finger, which by this time was beginning to darken
    at the point of venom deposition. I sucked on the finger until 8:35 a.m.,
    when a pan of ice water that I had requested was brought to me. No pain
    was felt except that caused by the ice. Fresh ice was added as needed to
    keep the temperature low. By 9:30 a.m. the finger had swollen and stiffened.
    At 10:00 a.m. the swelling had progressed to the index finger and back of
    the hand. I experienced difficulty in opening and closing the hand. Blood
    oozed slowly from the incision. A dull ache persisted and about every two
    to four minutes a sharp throb could be felt until nearly 11:00 a.m., when the
    pain diminished. The rate and intensity of throbbing increased whenever the
    hand was removed from the ice bath for more than a few seconds. Although
    only the hand was immersed, the entire forearm was cold. Pain was felt along
    the lymphatics on top of the arm when it was touched, and by 1:00 p.m. a
    slight pain could be felt in the armpit. Since swelling and pain were almost
    nonexistent by 2:00 p.m., I was permitted to leave. After walking to a nearby
    building, I again felt a burning sensation as the hand warmed. I made
    another ice bath and again immersed the hand in it until 4:10 p.m., at which
    time it was removed from the water. The pain and swelling began anew, and
    the hand was placed back in an ice bath from 5:30 p.m. until about 7:30 p.m.
    At this time cryotherapy was discontinued. From 10:00 p.m. to
    12:00 midnight my legs twitched periodically, and pain could be felt in both
    armpits. A slight difficulty in breathing also was experienced for a short time.
    The acute pain and burning sensation remained in the finger until the following
    morning, but swelling progressed only as far as the wrist. The only discomfort
    that day was in the finger. The tip was darkened, the entire first
    digit red and feverish, and the lymphatics still painful when touched. By the
    third day the swelling had regressed. The incision itself was the main cause
    of discomfort, and the soreness at the site of the bite persisted for at least four
    days.</p>
<p>Although the L-C method of snakebite treatment has been vigorously attacked
    by many, there is still need of much more data before it can be unequivocally
    condemned or praised. It was preferred in the treatment of this
    bite because: I knew that envenomation was minimal and that there would be
    no need for antivenin; only one fang of a snake less than one foot long had
    entered the tip of the finger; the snake had bitten three frogs in the previous <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span> two days and had possibly used up a considerable amount of its venom; the
    venom was deposited at such a shallow depth that at least a portion of it
    could be removed by suction; and the wound bled freely even before suction
    was applied. The ice water was uncomfortably cold but was not cold enough
    to cause frostbite, a major objection to the L-C method. Ideally, fresh ice
    should be added little by little to replace that which is melting, and the immersed
    area should be protected from the water by a plastic bag. Pain and
    swelling can be minimized by cryotherapy, but I would recommend its use
    only in cases of mild poisoning such as the one described herein.</p>
<h3>Snakebite in the United States</h3>
<p>Many estimates have been made of the number of bites of poisonous snakes
    that occur annually in the United States. The occurrence of poisonous snakebite
    has been nearly as badly underestimated as fatal results of their envenomations
    have been overrated. For important data on number of persons bitten
    by poisonous snakes in the United States, see the following: Allen and
    Swindell (1948:15); Githens (1935:172); Klauber (1956:811); Parrish (1963);
    Sowder and Gehres (1963:973); Stimson and Engelhardt (1960:153); Swaroop
    and Grab (1956:441); Swartzwelder (1950:579); Willson (1908:530); and
    Wood (1954b:937).</p>
<p>Judging from estimates made in several states, the number of poisonous
    snakebites in the United States would be about 5000 per year. In the region
    where the cottonmouth occurs there are approximately 2000 persons bitten
    annually by poisonous snakes. Of these approximately 39 per cent are copperhead
    bites, 30 per cent each are cottonmouth and rattlesnake bites, and I per
    cent are coral snake bites. These percentages vary considerably from place
    to place, because of the distribution and abundance of the eight species of
    poisonous snakes whose ranges overlap that of the cottonmouth.</p>
<p>According to Parrish (1963), about 14 people die of snakebite each year in
    the United States. Of these deaths, about 6.6 per cent are attributable to
    cottonmouths, 77.0 per cent to rattlesnakes, and 1.6 per cent to coral snakes;
    14.8 per cent are unidentified. Almost half of the fatalities are in persons
    less than 20 years of age, the high mortality rate being partially due to the
    greater ratio of venom to body weight.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In my study, 306 living and preserved cottonmouths were examined.
    This species occurs throughout the coastal plains of the
    southeastern United States, usually at altitudes of less than 500 feet
    but occasionally up to altitudes of more than 2000 feet.</p>
<p>Two subspecies are recognized: the eastern cottonmouth, <i>A. p.
    piscivorus</i>, occurring from extreme eastern Mississippi to southeastern
    Virginia and Florida; and the western cottonmouth, <i>A. p.
    leucostoma</i>, occurring from eastern Mississippi northward to southern
    Illinois and Missouri and westward to central Texas. Intergradation
    occurs in eastern Mississippi.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span></p>
<p>The northern edge of the range is probably limited by low temperatures
    in winter, and the western edge by lack of available
    habitat resulting from insufficient precipitation. Old records of occurrence
    indicate that the range has decreased in the last 100 years.
    The species inhabits mostly areas where water is found, but at times
    wanders a mile or more from the nearest water.</p>
<p>The ground color is predominantly a brown, but varies from a
    brownish-green to almost black with a pattern of 10 to 17 irregular
    bands of a darker shade of brown. The pattern is better defined in
    the eastern subspecies than in the western.</p>
<p>The scutellation resembles that of other species of <i>Agkistrodon</i>.
    In the specimens examined supralabials ranged from 7 to 9, and
    infralabials from 8 to 12. The number of dorsal scale rows on the
    neck, at mid-body, and immediately anterior to the anus is relatively
    constant at 27-25-21, respectively. Ventral scales of 34 males averaged
    134.4 (128 to 139), and those of 48 females 133.5 (128 to 137).
    The number of caudal scales showed some degree of sexual dimorphism;
    the average was 45.4 (41 to 50) in 34 males and 42.6
    (39 to 49) in 44 females. In general, caudal scales on the basal
    half of the tail are undivided, whereas those on the distal half are
    divided. No marked geographical variation was found in any scale
    character.</p>
<p>The poison fangs vary in length from 1.3 per cent of snout-vent
    length in juveniles to 1.0 per cent in large adults. Fangs of
    captive cottonmouths were shed and replaced at intervals of about
    21 days, but the interval was variable. Relationships in distance
    between the base of fangs and between fang punctures in an actual
    bite indicate that examination of the wound does not provide a
    good basis for judging accurately the size of the snake that inflicted
    the bite.</p>
<p>In general, females less than 450 millimeters in snout-vent length
    were juveniles; those more than 450 millimeters were classified as
    post partum or reproductive on the basis of sizes of ovarian follicles.
    Since about half the adult females were fecund, it was concluded
    that a biennial reproductive cycle occurs in this species. An annual
    cycle may occur in areas where temperature permits year-round
    activity. It was estimated that females become sexually mature at
    an age of approximately two and one-half years. Mating is probably
    most concentrated in early spring at about the time when females
    ovulate, but copulation is not a stimulus for ovulation. Sperm
    retention and delayed fertilization allow young to be produced without <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span> copulation occurring in each breeding season. The testes increase
    in size gradually rather than rapidly at maturity or in each
    breeding season, but seasonal cycles in sperm production occur.</p>
<p>The gestation period is three and one-half to four months. Determination
    of sex in the embryos is possible by late June, because
    the hemipenes of males are evaginated until the time of birth.
    Parturition generally occurs in August or September, but captivity
    may delay birth for a month or more. From one to 16 young per
    litter are born, depending on size of the mother and other factors;
    but the average is between six and seven. Mortality rate at birth is
    high in captive individuals but has not been determined in natural
    populations. The sex ratio in embryos and adults examined revealed
    about 53 per cent females. Because sufficient information on
    population composition is not available, an estimate of the percentage
    of adults in a natural population was based upon the number
    found in my study. The reproductive potential was estimated
    from these figures.</p>
<p>Normal young at birth are 230 to 240 millimeters in snout-vent
    length, but their size is influenced by the condition of the mother.
    Comparison of newborn young with those captured in spring
    indicates that little growth occurs during winter. Early growth is
    largely dependent upon feeding before winter quiescence.</p>
<p>The umbilical cord is broken at birth and the navel closes within
    a few days, but the scar remains throughout life. Sexual dimorphism
    in the position of the scar is characteristic of some snakes but is
    minimal in cottonmouths.</p>
<p>In those snakes more than 700 millimeters in length, males outnumber
    females three to one. The maximum age of cottonmouths
    in nature is unknown, but one has been kept in captivity for more
    than 18 years.</p>
<p>Allometric growth is striking in cottonmouths. The head and
    tail are proportionately longer in young individuals than in adults;
    and in males the tail is, on the average, slightly longer than in
    females of the same size.</p>
<p>Shedding of the skin provides for growth and wear in snakes.
    The young shed within a few days after birth and generally shed
    more frequently than adults. Frequency of shedding depends
    mostly on amount of food consumed, and there is some evidence
    that injuries on the head and neck increase the frequency of shedding.
    Before shedding, the eyes become cloudy for about five <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span> and one-half days, then clear up again for about four days before
    the skin is shed.</p>
<p>The food of cottonmouths consists mainly of small vertebrates
    and occasionally invertebrates that are found near water. Fish,
    amphibians, and reptiles make up nearly 70 per cent of the diet.
    Carrion is also eaten and cannibalism occurs occasionally. Food
    is obtained by lying in ambush or by active searching. The young
    are known to lure their prey within striking range by waving their
    yellow tails in a manner suggestive of writhing grubs. The method
    of obtaining prey differs according to the kind of prey. Generally,
    cottonmouths retain their hold on fish or frogs but release mice
    and larger prey after delivering a bite.</p>
<p>The major causes of mortality of cottonmouths are obscure.
    Predators are known to include alligators, indigo snakes, king-snakes,
    largemouth bass, and blue herons; there are probably
    numerous others. Heavy parasitic infestations were found among
    the snakes examined. Snake mites, <i>Ophionyssus natricus</i>, became
    increasingly abundant on almost all captive snakes in April and
    May of 1963. Lung flukes (<i>Ochetosoma</i> sp.) were in 16 of 20
    captive snakes, and many preserved specimens contained nematodes
    (<i>Kalicephalus</i> sp.) in the stomach and/or tapeworms (<i>Ophiotaenia</i> sp.) in the intestine. Although parasitic infestation causes discomfort
    and may lower resistance to other detrimental factors, it
    is difficult to attribute death to the effect of any particular kind
    of parasite. Miscellaneous causes of death of some captive snakes
    also were discussed.</p>
<p>The maximal body temperatures tolerated by four cottonmouths
    were between 38&deg; and 40&deg; C., but a temperature of 38&deg; was lethal
    to a fifth individual. Cottonmouths have been found on occasion
    when other snakes were inactive because of low temperatures, but
    minimal temperatures tolerated by this species are not known. The
    annual cycle of activity is dependent upon temperature and thus
    varies from north to south. Cottonmouths generally migrate inland
    in autumn, usually to dry forested hillsides, where they den along
    with other species of snakes. After a few warm days in spring
    they migrate back to the water's edge. The diel activity cycle likewise
    depends upon temperatures but is influenced by other factors
    as well. In spring and autumn, the snakes are active mostly on
    warm, sunny days, whereas in summer they are active mostly at
    night. In order to maintain adequate internal temperatures, much <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span> time is spent basking mostly in a characteristic flat, resting coil
    either beside a body of water or above water on limbs of dead
    trees. In this position the snake is ready either for a short strike
    or a hasty getaway.</p>
<p>Juveniles appear particularly aggressive and strike repeatedly
    when approached, a behavioral pattern definitely favoring survival.
    Adults vary in disposition, usually appearing sluggish and lazy,
    but they are capable of striking rapidly when disturbed. The typical
    threat display consists of lying in a coiled position with the mouth
    opened widely, exposing the white interior, and with the tail vibrating
    rapidly. The striking posture resembles the resting coil except
    that the anterior part of the body is raised off the ground and the
    mouth is sometimes opened. Musk is often ejected in a fine spray
    from glands in the tail as a further defensive action.</p>
<p>&quot;Head bobbing,&quot; more properly described as spastic contractions
    of the body, was observed in captives when food was introduced
    into a cage containing several individuals or when one of the
    snakes was returned to the cage after being handled. Reports in
    the literature also have connected these jerking movements with
    courtship. The response appears to be elicited whenever a nervous
    state is recognized in another individual and may serve to protect
    the jerking individual from aggressive advances of the former.</p>
<p>The relatively heavy appearance of the body, sluggish habits,
    and cryptic coloration are correlated with the development of
    venom and fangs. The poison apparatus has developed primarily
    as a means of causing rapid death in prey and secondarily, perhaps,
    to begin the digestion of small animals that are the usual prey, but
    it is also important as a defensive device. The venom contains at
    least eight constituents that aid in its action on prey. Toxicity of
    the venom is difficult to determine because of numerous variables,
    but cottonmouth venom is generally believed to be less potent
    than that of most rattlesnakes and more potent than that of the
    copperhead. Snakes in general are more resistant to snake venoms
    than other vertebrates of similar size, but there is no immunity
    even to their own venom.</p>
<p>About ten per cent of the approximately 5000 bites of poisonous
    snakes per year in the United States are attributable to cottonmouths,
    and about seven per cent of the approximately 14 deaths
    per year are caused by cottonmouths.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
